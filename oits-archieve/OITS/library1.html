<FONT FACE="TAHOMA"><CENTER><U>CURRENT FOCUS: Establishment of  an OITS library
</FONT></CENTER></U><BR><BR>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELEVETICA"><FONT SIZE=+1>TIME LINE:</FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">Send at least 1000 books by Sept 15.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELEVETICA"><FONT SIZE=+1>PLAN:</FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
Our plan is to establish a library of books, softwares, 
research papers, etc related to IT  in Orissa. As a start we
will have a physical location in Bhubaneswar. Later we may have
branches in other cities. Our next targets will be from Berhempur,
Rourkela and Sambalpur.

<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELEVETICA"><FONT SIZE=+1>LOCATION RATIONALE: </FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
The library will be located in one of the IT institutions
(among the dozen or so private Engg colleges, MCA granting institutions,
govt colleges, universities, OCAC, IIIT precursor, etc.).
The exact location will be chosen based on which institutions
gives us the maximum facilities
(room, shelves, a librarian,  Internet connection, etc.)
We believe if we have 1000 books which at $50 a book
will be worth $50,000 (or 21 lakh rupees), the various institutions
will compete against each other to give us a good deal as having
the library in their campus will increase their visibility.
From our point of view, it will save us time and the hassle of 
constructing a building, operating the library, etc. etc.

<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELEVETICA"><FONT SIZE=+1>USERS:</FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
The library will be accessible to any OITS member or student member.
Recall that BBSR now has several private engineering colleges
offering B.E in CS, several MCA granting institutions, 
and 3 colleges offering B.Sc in Computer Science (hons). The
library will have a big impact on the faculty and students of these
institutions and may play a role in influencing IT companies decisions
to have a location in BBSR.

<FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELEVETICA"><FONT SIZE=+1>BOOK COLLECTION DRIVE: </FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
(a) IT faculty: Publishers in the US send complementary copies
to  instructors and professors and over the year they have a lot
of books that they don't use or have multiple copies of the same 
book. Oriya faculty should try to donate these books. They may
also collect books from their colleagues in the same institution
or at other institutions. Others who may have faculty friends may try 
to collect books from those friends. (Same goes about softwares.)
Also, IT faculty should also have a selection of their papers in the
library. This will be beneficial to both the faculty whose papers
will be in the library and students/faculty in Orissa who may browse them
and decide to pursue research in a similar field.
<P>
As an example,  Prof. Chitta Baral was able to collect 49 books
in one day from his shelves and from one of his colleagues.
<P>
(b) IT professionals: Besides contributing some books (which may not
be as many as the faculty) they can contribute software packages
and manuals (or product use books) from their company. 
<P>
(c) Students: Students can try to collect books for this cause
from their faculty, or start a collection drive through the
Indian association in their respective universities.
<P>
(d) Others: Can contribute any IT books they may have or can 
collect from their friends who may have such books.

<FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELEVETICA"><FONT SIZE=+1>COMPUTER DONATION:</FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
We would also like to have your spare computers (486 or above)
in the library.
</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELEVETICA"><FONT SIZE=+1>SHIPPING MODALITIES</FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
<p>
Our society just started and we really have very little money.
So any help in bearing part or all of the shipping cost
will be really useful.  This is just a request. Even without that 
we will really appreciate your donation of books. 
<BR>
If you are in a metropolitan area we may be able to pick the books
from you personally through a  volunteer. Please send a message
