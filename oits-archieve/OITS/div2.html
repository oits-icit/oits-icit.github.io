A proposal made by some OITS members to establish
B.Sc (Hons) and pass courses in computer science was 
discussed with delegates from Orissa (CM, Chief Secy, etc.) 
in July 97, and a formal proposal was later submitted
to the Orissa government and various universities in Orissa.
<p>
The main idea behind the proposal -- with 
an eye towards little additional cost to the government --
was to establish computer science
programs that can be replicated easily in
all corners of Orissa, with existing infrastructure 
and retraining of existing Physics and Mathematics lecturers.
<p>
In December 97 the proposal was acted upon by the
Orissa government and it was decided to open B.Sc (Hons)
in Computer Science in 6 colleges in Orissa: B.J.B and
Rama Devi in Bhubaneswar; Ravenshaw in Cuttack;
Khallikote in Berhampur, G. M in Sambalpur and Govt. College
in Rourkela. 
<p>
In summer of 1998, 5 lecturers from each of the above colleges
were trained at OCAC for six weeks and the B.Sc classes
in Computer Science are supposed to start in the middle of 
September 98. The lecturers trained in summer 98,
will be trained in additional topics in the coming
summers. The govt is thinking of having the same programs in
additional colleges and many private colleges have also
expressed interest in having them.
<p>
Following is the proposal that was sent to the government.
