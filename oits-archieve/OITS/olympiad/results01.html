          ORISSA INFORMATION  TECHNOLOGY OLYMPIAD
               HELD     ON 2ND SEPTEMBER, 2001

 Orissa Information Technology Society (OITS) conducted a quiz test at
senior (MCA, BE, B.Sc.(Eng) and B.Sc.(hons)) and junior (upto class XII)
levels with separate questions, on 2nd September, 2001. We tried to
contact Berhampur, Puri, Sambalpur/Burla, Rourkela, Sarang, Cuttack 
and Bhubaneswar, but we could not obtain response from Rourkela and Sambalpur
or Burla. About 1100 students registered for the same, and a 
little less than one thousand students appeared. Organisationally, the 
contest was modelled after Orissa Mathematics Olympiad of Orissa
Mathematics Society, where upto 10,000 students appear every year (at
junior and senior levels). Professor Sudarshan Padhy, Secretary, OITS 
mainly coordinated this activity, with able assistance from P.K. Behera, 
Treasurer, OITS, and Manas Patra, joint secretary, OITS, Berhampur with 
help from many others including M.Tech. (Comp Sc) students (who were not 
eligible to contest). The results at senior and junior levels are as below.
Special prizes were
awarded to B.Sc. (hons) students at senior level, and upto Class X
students at the junior level, since relative to the bulk of candidates, 
they had less exposure to the study of computer science/IT.

</p>
<p>
  This year the participation got confined to Berhampur, Puri, Sarang, 
Cuttack and Bhubaneswar. We do hope that next year we can streamline 
this activity and have a larger number of students covering all parts of 
Orissa.

</p>
<p>
  We now give the results of the olympiad examinations at senior and junior
levels as below:
