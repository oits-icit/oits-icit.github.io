<P></P>
<P>Orissa Information Technology Society (OITS) conducted a quiz test at senior 
(MCA, BE, B.Sc.(Eng) and B.Sc.(hons)) and junior (upto class XII) levels with 
separate questions, on 25th September, 2005. We contacted Berhampur, Puri, 
Sambalpur/Burla, Rourkela, Sarang, Cuttack, Raygada, Balasore, Damanjodi, 
Paradeep, Angul and Bhubaneswar. About 1500 students registered for the same, 
and around one thousand and four hundred students appeared. Organisationally, 
the contest was modelled the same way as last year. This year there was a 
very positive response from Rourkela, Sambalpur/Burla, Raygada and Balasore 
and some other places as additional venues. The response from Bhubaneswar also
increased compared to last year. Professor Sudarshan Padhy, Coordinator, 
IT Olympiad mainly organised this activity, with able assistance from many 
people as announced as well as many others, including M.Tech. (Comp Sc) 
students, who were not eligible to contest, and young faculty members, 
came forward to help. This year we did central valuation with participation 
of more than twenty faculty members. 
The results at senior and junior levels are as below.
