 Orissa Information Technology Society (OITS) conducted a quiz test at
senior (MCA, BE, B.Sc.(Eng) and B.Sc.(hons)) and junior (upto class XII)
levels with separate questions, on 1st September, 2002. We contacted 
Berhampur, Puri, Sambalpur/Burla, Rourkela, Sarang, Cuttack, Raygada, Baripada
and Bhubaneswar.  About 1100 students registered for the same, and around 
one thousand students appeared. Organisationally, the contest was modelled 
the  same way as last year. This year there was a very positive response
from Rourkela, Sambalpur/Burla, Raygada and Baripada as additional venues. 
But the response from Berhampur decreased as many students had 
examinations.  Professor Sudarshan Padhy, Secretary, OITS mainly coordinated 
this activity, with able assistance from Dr. S.K. Sahu, Sambalpur, Dr. A.K. 
Otta, Sc College, Rourkela, Dr. B Majhi, NIT, Rourkela, P.K. Behera, Treasurer, 
OITS, and, Dr. Manas Patra and  V.K. Das from Berhampur. Also many others, 
including M.Tech. (Comp Sc) students, who were not eligible to contest, and  
young faculty members, came forward to help. The results at senior and junior 
levels are as below.
