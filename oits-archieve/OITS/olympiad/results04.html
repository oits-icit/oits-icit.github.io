<CENTER>ORISSA INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY OLYMPIAD 
<P></P>HELD ON 29TH AUGUST, 2004 </CENTER></B>
<P></P>
<P>Orissa Information Technology Society (OITS) conducted a quiz test at senior 
(MCA, BE, B.Sc.(Eng) and B.Sc.(hons)) and junior (upto class XII) levels with 
separate questions, on 29th August, 2004. We contacted Berhampur, Puri, 
Sambalpur/Burla, Rourkela, Sarang, Cuttack, Raygada, Balasore, Damanjodi, 
Paradeep, Angul and Bhubaneswar. About 1200 students registered for the same, 
and around one thousand students appeared. Organisationally, the contest was 
modelled the same way as last year. This year there was a very positive response 
from Rourkela, Sambalpur/Burla, Raygada and Balasore and some other places as 
additional venues. But the response from Bhubaneswar decreased as many students 
had examinations. Professor Sudarshan Padhy, Coordinator, IT Olympiad mainly 
organised this activity, with able assistance from many people as announced as 
well as many others, including M.Tech. (Comp Sc) students, who were not eligible 
to contest, and young faculty members, came forward to help. The results at 
senior and junior levels are as below. </P>
