 Orissa Information Technology Society (OITS) conducted a quiz test at
senior (MCA, BE, B.Sc.(Eng) and B.Sc.(hons)) and junior (upto class XII)
levels with separate questions, on 7th September, 2003. We contacted 
Berhampur, Puri, Sambalpur/Burla, Rourkela, Sarang, Cuttack, Raygada, 
Balasore, Damanjodi, Paradeep, Angul
and Bhubaneswar.  About 1200 students registered for the same, and around 
one thousand students appeared. Organisationally, the contest was modelled 
the  same way as last year. This year there was a very positive response
from Rourkela, Sambalpur/Burla, Raygada and Balasore and some other places 
as additional venues. 
But the response from Bhubaneswar decreased as many students had 
examinations.  Professor Sudarshan Padhy, Coordinator, IT Olympiad mainly 
organised this activity, with able assistance from many people as announced 
as well as many others, 
including M.Tech. (Comp Sc) students, who were not eligible to contest, and  
young faculty members, came forward to help. The results at senior and junior 
levels are as below.

          ORISSA IT OLYMPIAD PRIZE DISTRIBUTION 
<p>
</p>
               HELD  ON 18TH JANUARY, 2004

<p>
</p>
<p>
The IT olympiad prize distribution function was held on 18th January, 2004
at 2.30 pm. The Chief Guest was Bikramjit Maitra, Head, Infosys Centre at
Bhubaneswar, and the guest of honour was Gautam Parija, administrative
head, Infosys Centre, Bhubaneswar. Arun Samantaray, Administrator, Utkal
University, presided over the function. All the prize winners, along with
their teachers were specially invited. Also, the parents of the prize
winners at junior level were separetely invited. There were altogether
about 70 to 80 participants.
</p>
<p>

The president of oits, S P Misra, welcomed the participants. Next Sudarshan
Padhy, Coordinator, IT olympiad program, spoke about the conduct of the
olympiad examination, and referred to the fact that on this occasion  there
were about nineteen centres in  which the students appeared, spread all over
Orissa.
</p>
<p>

Prizes were distributed by the Chief Guest, Bikramjit Maitra. In the
senior category, the first, second and third rank examinees were given
cash prizes of Rs.3,000/-, Rs.2,000/- and Rs.1,000/- respectively, and
consolation prizes of Rs.500/- each for the remaining eight examinees 
above, along with certificates. In the junior category, also the first, 
second and third rank examinees were given cash prizes of Rs.3,000/-, 
Rs.2,000/- and Rs.1,000/- respectively, and consolation prizes of Rs.500/- 
each for the remaining nine examinees, along with certificates. Most of
the prize winners took these prizes, and for those who were absent, the
amounts along with the certificates were sent by courier.
</p>
<p>

The Chief Guest addressed the gathering emphasizing the relevance of IT in
all phases of our Society. He also emphasized that Infosys has always wanted
to increase the number of selected candidates from Orissa, if they
satisfy minimal norms needed for it. He mentioned that parallel
to Olympiad tests, the selection process in Infosys takes  into account
not only the background knowledge of the candidates, but also their
ability to think and adapt themselves to learn new techniques in computer
science, since it needs continuous upgrading of ones capabilities. Gautam
Parija also emphasized that for selection in Infosys the ability of candidates 
as such shall always be as important  as the knowledge they have already 
acquired.
</p>
<p>

Arun K Samantarai, Administrator, Utkal University also focussed on the  role
of IT in Society. He particularly emphasized the need  for closer collaboration
with industry to make such programs a success. While all lauded this activity
of oits, Sri Samantarai emphasized that assistance could be sought from
Industry for such programs. The experts from Infosys readily agreed to the
same keeping in mind the constraints they have.
</p>
<p>

S P Misra emphasized on two aspects for an extension of the  Olympiad
activity. (i) He mentioned that there is  an attempt to coordinate this
activity with a similar activity at all India level, so that  a limited 
number of the students here  could be selected to attend the training 
program  at national level, and then if they do very well, get selected  for
international competetion. (ii) He also mentioned that from next year it
is planned to  have a short training program of the best students to
enable them  to  face stiffer competetion. In particular  Infosys assured
that  this can be done at their  level  if we  plan out a program  which
will not affect the usual routine  work of Infosys.
</p>
<p>

There  was then  a tea break, after which like  last year an  interactive
session was conducted in the presence  of Bikramjit  Maitra and Gautam Parija.
Here students asked  many questions, which were mainly answered  by the 
visitors, along with  open house discussions participated by many experts
and   students.  The point regarding further training  of the prize winners
was further emphasized regarding  which   assurance was given by Maitra.
Another thing that emerged was that some computers - about forty or fifty -
could  be donated by Infosys for use in some schools, for which appropriate
modalities could be worked out.
</p>
<p>

oits president S P Misra mentioned that any of the students who wish to keep
in touch with oits could visit the website www.oits.org, or mail to him
(spmisra1@sancharnet.in) so that  arrangements can be made to keep them
informed.

The meeting ended with a vote of thanks by Ajit Nayak, treasurer, oits as
the secretary was absent.
