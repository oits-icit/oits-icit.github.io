<P></P>HELD ON 24TH SEPTEMBER, 2006 </CENTER></font></B>
<P></P>
<P>Orissa Information Technology Society (OITS) conducted a quiz test at senior 
(MCA, BE, B.Sc.(Eng) and B.Sc.(hons)) and junior (upto class XII and Diploma in Engg.)
levels with separate questions, on 24th September, 2006. We contacted Berhampur, Puri, 
Sambalpur/Burla, Rourkela, Sarang, Cuttack, Dhenkanal, Raygada, Balasore, Damanjodi, 
Paradeep, Angul, Paralakhemundi, Balasore and Bhubaneswar. 
About 1560 students registered for the same, 
and around 1200 students appeared. Organisationally, 
the contest was modelled the same way as last year. This year there was a 
very positive response from Rourkela, Sambalpur/Burla, Raygada and Balasore 
and some other places as additional venues. The response from Bhubaneswar has been
decreased compared to last year because of BPUT internal examinations. 
Professor Sudarshan Padhy, Coordinator, IT Olympiad mainly organised this activity, 
with able assistance from many people as announced as well as many others, 
including M.Tech. (Comp Sc) students, who were not eligible to contest, and young 
faculty members, came forward to help. This year we did central valuation with participation 
of more than twenty faculty members. The results at senior and junior levels are as below.
