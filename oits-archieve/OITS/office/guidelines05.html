Dear All
</p><p>
It is high time to contact potential host
institutions to organize CIT 2005. Last year, we received 2-3 requests (ITER,
Bhubaneswar ; IIIT Allahabad and another School from
Bhubaneswar. The guidelines and request forms were not formalized then. I
have enclosed the relevant documents for you to circulate among the
Institutions at Bhubaneswar and check if any one is interested to host the 
CIT 2005. I shall request the OITS body to be pro-active in this process and 
help identifying the host institutions. I shall appreciate inputs from all 
of you. We need to identify the host by November 1 so that they can take 
time to design the CFP and build a team of volunteers for CIT 2005. The 
call for paper should be available at CIT 2004 conference.
</p><p>
Any feed back from any of you shall be very welcome.
