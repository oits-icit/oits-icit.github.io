In his inauguration speech at the first National Conference in 
Information Technology -- NCIT 97 -- held in Bhubaneswar in Dec 
1997, the additional chief secretary of Orissa, Mr. P. K. Mishra,
compared Orissa with Tamilnadu and Karnataka in terms of the
number of engineering graduates per year. While Karnataka graduates 
20,000 engineers per year and Tamilnadu graduates 25,000 engineers 
per year, Orissa graduates only 2,100 engineers per year. Even 
taking into account the populations of these states --  Orissa's 
population is 31.66 million while Karnataka's is 44.977m and 
Tamilnadu's is 55.859m -- Orissa is way behind these states. No 
wonder Bangalore and Chennai are the destinations for major 
technology companies.
<P>
This reality is disheartening. But the good news is that despite 
the not so good economic state of affairs of the Orissa government, 
in the last couple of years some major steps have been taken and 
several events have happened -- some with NRO initiatives -- which 
is very promising for Orissa.
<P>
To start with  when I finished my I.Sc. in 1983 there were two 
established general Engineering Colleges in Orissa (REC Rourkela 
and UCE Burla) and one had just opened in Bhubaneswar (CET). In the 
next five years IGIT was established in Sarang, Talcher and the 
first private Engineering College, Orissa College of Engineering 
was established in the Bhubaneswar area.
<P>
Guess how many Engineering colleges are there in Orissa now?
<P>
Around Seventeen. About 10 of them -- all private -- have been established 
in the last 2 years. Some of them are: Kalinga Institute of 
Industrial Technology, C. V. Raman, Institute of Technology and 
Engineering Research (all in BBSR), Ajai Binay -- for Architecture, 
Jagannath Inst of Engg Tech (both in Cuttack), National Inst of 
Science and Tech and SMIT (both in Berhempur), Ghanashyam Hemalata 
Inst of Engg and Technology, FCI engineering college, Barapada 
Engineering college, Paralakhemundi Engg College, Gunpur Engg 
College, etc. Besides, there are already more than 10 places that 
offer University affiliated MCA program. Some of them are: REC, UCE, 
IGIT, Utkal Univ, Sambalpur Univ, Berhempur University, Ravenshaw 
College, Khallikote College, KIIT, Orissa Computer Academy, IISIT, etc.
The last three are private institutions in Bhubaneswar. In December 
1997, the Orissa govt approved another 8-10 private institutions to 
offer MCA, and I am aware of additional institutions that are in
the planning stage.
<P>
I applaud the government for opening and encouraging the private 
sector to invest in higher education. On the other hand there may be 
some worries about the nature of operations at these new private 
institutions and colleges. Most of them require significant capitation 
fees which they use towards there operation. But they are required to set
aside certain percentages -- I think 50% -- of the seats for purely merit 
based admission without capitation fees. Despite many critics, I 
consider this to be a positive development and added opportunity for
us (NROs) to be involved in helping and making sure these institutions
provide adequate faculty and facilities. Since they are private they 
are much more flexible, are more amenable to new ideas, and can 
incorporate them faster. For example, I was told that NIST in Berhempur 
has students who work as teaching assistants. Similarly, both NIST and
KIIT in Bhubaneswar have good email and Internet access. In Dec-Jan 
97-98 I had the opportunity to interact with some of these private 
institutions, their faculty and their students. In terms of facilities 
and vision I was impressed with KIIT, with its campus in Patia on the 
Nandan Kanan road. They had an excellent computer lab, a very nice
and clean building -- with warning signs not to spit -- and a visionary 
in Dr. P. K. Mishra, who is looking for top notch visiting faculty 
from any where. Although I did not visit NIST in Berhempur, I met 
a few faculty from there and I have corresponded with its founders. 
One of its founders works at Lucent and the other was in US for several 
years. Their course structure was developed by leading NRO computer 
professors from US. I also met faculty and students from OEC, Orissa 
Computer Academy and IISIT and visited IISIT's campus. They all seemed to
me in good shape.
<P>
I came to know about this recent development during my last visit
to Bhubaneswar. Some of these institutions sponsored luncheons, dinners,
and cultural activities at the other major event that happened in 1997, 
the NCIT 97 conference. Now a few words on my impression on this conference:
<P>
NCIT-97, the national conference on information technology was held
in Utkal University during Dec 21-23 with active organizational help
from the faculty and students of the Dept. of Computer Science and
Application of the Utkal university. It brought together Computer 
scientists and students (mostly of Oriya origin) from universities, 
institutes, and companies in Orissa, India, USA and Australia, such as: 
IIT Guwahati, U of Hyderabad, IISc B'lore, Utkal, Berhempur, KIIT,
NIST, OEC, REC, IISIT, ACE, Texas A &M, HCL, Adobe, VLSI Tech, etc. There
were also participants from Orissa govt and Orissa govt enterprises 
such as OSEDC and OCAC.
<P>
 Some of the highlights of the conference were:
<P>
 * Keynote addresses by Prof. L. M. Patnaik of IISc Bangalore, 
   one of the top computer scientists in India; and    by Prof. 
   S. K. Pal from ISI Calcutta.
 <P>
 * An interesting array of technical talks and panels.
 <P>
 * A panel session where the director of NIC and the Chief exec of OCAC
   outlined the procedure of how educational institutions in Orissa can get
   Internet access from them at minimal cost. (Since the panel, the CS 
   and Appl. dept of Utkal has got email access.)
 <P>
 * A consistent attendance between 150-250 in all sessions.
 <P>
 * A beautiful cultural show held in the first evening at the
   Kalinga Inst of Industrial Tech campus in Patia, BBSR.
   The show had Odissi, chhau and other dances from Orissa.
 <P>
 * A panel on studying abroad, where many details about the procedure
   to study in USA and Australia were discussed.
 <P>
 * The formation of the Orissa Information Technology Society, with 
   Dr. S. P. Mishra as its founding president. (Dr. Mishra has taught 
   Physics and Mathematics in Ravenshaw college, REC RKL, Inst
   of Physics; and is currently also the President of Orissa Science Academy.
   He has been championing the use of email and Internet by scientists
   in all fields, by students in colleges, etc., and is the only
   one in BBSR who knows Latex, has a postscript printer, has LINUX
   installed in his PC etc. :-)  )
 <P>
 * The announcement of a similar conference in December 1998 
   (which is now called ICIT 98), with Prof. L. M. Patnaik 
   as the Conference Chair and Prof. Rabi Mohapatra -- rabi@cs.tamu.edu
   (Texas A & M Univ), Dr. A. K. Pujari (Chief Exec OCAC), and 
   Prof. G. Panda  (REC Rourkela)    as program chairs.
<P>
The abstracts of NCIT 97 is available at
http://cs.utep.edu/chitta/ncit97
and the details about ICIT'98 is available at 
http://www.cs.tamu.edu/cit'98. As an illustration of how
an idea became a reality, I would now like to briefly describe how 
this conference came about. Dr. Hrushikesh Mohanty, a Reader in computer
science at the University of Hyderabad was trying to organize one of the
Indian computer science conferences in Orissa and in that context had 
discussions with Dr. Meher, HOD of the Computer Sc and Applications 
dept of Utkal University. The conference did not materialize, but as 
a result Dr. Mohanty felt strongly the need for establishing an 
organization which he called Orissa Computer Congress, which, among
other things, would make it easier to arrange for such Computer related 
events in Orissa. In September of 1997, I posted a message to 
ornet@cs.columbia.edu enquiring about a friend of mine from IIT 
Kharagpur. Dr. Mohanty, who is also an alumnus of IIT KGP, replied 
to my message and we exchanged several mails enquiring about each other.<P>
During this exchange he mentioned about Orissa Computing Congress.
This idea struck a chord in me and I suggested that  perhaps we should 
have it that December. Within a few days Dr. Mohanty took care of some 
of his prior plans for December and we decided to have a conference 
on computing in December in Bhubaneswar. We decided that we will have 
it in whatever scale possible and with whatever help we can get.
Our first contact in Bhubaneswar was Jyoti Nanda from NIC who was known 
to Dr. Mohanty and who had email access at NIC. While Jyoti organized 
a group in Bhubaneswar, Dr. Mohanty and myself used ornet@cs.columbia.edu
to spread the word in the cyberspace. Unfortunately due to a fatal 
scooter accident Jyoti left us before seeing his dream fulfilled. 
Dr. Meher and his colleagues from the Dept of Computer Sc and application
at Utkal University, and Suchitra Patnaik, CEO, Tekons Services, 
Bhubaneswar and one of the co-founders of ORICOM -- the first private 
computer firm in Orissa which was established around 1986 -- took over the 
organizational aspects in Orissa. They also suggested to broaden the 
conference scope and name from `computers' to `information technology'.
In the US, Dr. Rabi Mohapatra and Purna Mohanty helped in the organization,
and IEDSO (International economic development society of Orissa, an 
organization headed by Somdutt Behura, Manas Patnaik, Gopal Mohapatra,
and Purna Mohanty) and several individuals sponsored the registration 
fees for several students.
<P>
In the conference Dr. Mohanty, Dr. Meher and myself met each other
for the first time. In other words from the conception to its occurrence
much of the communication about the conference was done through Internet.
<P>
Recall that the Orissa Computing Congress was initially envisioned 
as an organization. Along these line, there was a business meeting 
during the conference where ``Orissa Information Technology Society'' was
established. Here are some of the by-laws of this society:
<P>
A.   The Society is named as the Orissa Information Technology
     Society, hereinafter referred as OITS.
<P>
B.   Membership of OITS:
     Any professional in Information Technology or interested
     in the same shall be eligible to be a member of OITS.
<P>
C.   Aims and Objectives of OITS is to
     i.   promote education and research in information
          technology (IT) primarily in Orissa.<BR>
     ii.  promote collaboration of information technology personnel
          in Orissa and abroad.<BR>
     iii. promote the usage of IT products in Orissa.<BR>
     iv.  organize annual conferences/symposia and workshops
          in IT areas.<BR>
     v.   publish periodicals and journals on IT.<BR>
     vi.  discuss and encourage young talents on IT.<BR>
     vii. felicitate persons having outstanding contributions for
          education, research and technology in IT areas.<BR>
<P>
Additional information on this organization is available at
http://cs.utep.edu/chitta/occ and the main contact persons are
Dr. S. P. Mishra (spmisra@acad.ori.nic.in or 
scacad@ori.ori.nic.in@nicnet.nic.in) and myself (chitta@cs.utep.edu).
I consider the establishment of private engineering colleges,
and MCA granting institutes, the holding of NCIT 97 and the 
establishment of OITS to be major events that will have a big 
impact on the IT infrastructure of Orissa. But, all these
still leave out large part of Orissa unimpacted with information
technology infrastructure. Here, I am referring to places that 
are not close to an university, or an engineering college or a 
college with post graduate programs. One other recent Orissa govt 
decision is aimed at this. Again, as an illustration of of going from 
ideas to policy, I now describe my perspective and involvement on this.
<P>

During the Invest Orissa Symposium at Houston in June-July 97,
I met several Orissa ministers and bureaucrats. To provide educational 
opportunities in information technology all through out Orissa -- not 
just in a selected few places -- I suggested them that colleges 
offering science degrees in Orissa should offer programs in B.Sc 
(Hons) in Computer Science. The main importance of such a program 
is that it could be made available in many more colleges than programs 
like B.Engg or MCA which by definition can only be in engineering
colleges and post graduate colleges, respectively. With positive response
from them and from participants at OSA 97, and with feedback from ornet,
I sent a written proposal to the Orissa govt. (This proposal is 
available at http://cs.utep.edu/chitta/orissa/bsc. ) When I visited 
Orissa in Dec 97, I met the additional Chief secretary, Secretary 
of Education and Secretary of Science and Technology and the 
Orissa govt took a decision to establish pilot programs in B.Sc 
(Hons) in Computer Science (together with pass options with other 
honours choices) in six colleges: B.J.B College, Bhubaneswar; 
Ravenshaw College, Cuttack; G. M. College, Sambalpur; 
Khallikote College, Berhempur; R. D. Women's College, Bhubaneswar; 
and Govt College, Rourkela. (Earlier, S.C.S college
in Puri had been authorized and funded by UGC for a
vocational B.Sc program -- but without honors -- in Computer 
Science.) Although the program is designed so as to utilize as much 
of the current available infrastructure as possible -- such as, 
retraining current science faculties in computer science and using 
the class rooms and offices that are already there, there is still 
some cost involved and the Orissa government can not afford to have 
this programs at too many places in one go. But, once the model 
is established I hope OSA members and others will pitch in to have these
programs in their favorite colleges, or in colleges in places 
near and/or dear to them.
<P>
So far I have mostly discussed the IT infrastructure of Orissa in
terms of educational opportunities, the OITS and the NCIT and ICIT 
conferences. Now a brief picture on the other aspects. Currently, 
the main national software companies with operations in Bhubaneswar are
Infosys Technology  and Satyam Computers. There are also several
smaller companies such as ORICOM and TEKONS services. I am excited 
by a recent venture being planned by Prabhu Mohapatra (prabhu@aiol.com). His company called ``All India On-Line'' "AIOL" 
envisions to Connect Indians Worldwide. Prabhu has a ISP 
(Internet Service Provider) company in the USA and will be taking 
his experience to India. Some of the other organizations in Bhubaneswar 
that play a big role in information technology are: Software Technology 
Park (STP), Xaviers School of Management (XIM), Orissa Computer 
Application Center (OCAC), National Informatics Center (NIC), and
Orissa State Electronic Development Corporation (OSEDC). Some of the 
people in the Orissa govt or its subsidiaries that I have personally 
found very receptive of ideas from NROs are Sidhartha Pradhan 
(Dept of Public Enterprises, Orissa Govt), Aditya Padhi (IPICOL), G. S. Mishra 
(OSEDC), and S. B. Mishra (Chief Secretary). Besides the many names
I have mentioned earlier in this article, some of the other individuals
in Orissa that are actively involved in IT aspects and may
serve as contact points are: Dr. Sanghamitra Mohanty (Utkal University),
Dr. Surendra Nayak (On deputation to Dept of Sc and Technology, Orissa govt), 
Laxman Mohanty (ORICOM), Rakesh Agrawal (INFOSYS), Manas Ranjan 
Patra (Berhempur Univ), Manas Patnaik (STP), and Dr. Manoj Nayak (OUAT).
<P>
To round of the good aspects of the IT infrastructure, I would
like to applaud the decision taken by the Orissa government 
to declare areas around Bhubaneswar as pollution free and not to allow any 
polluting industries in that area. I was impressed that the ministers
were actively marketing this feature of Bhubaneswar to potential 
Info tech investors during the Houston symposium.
<P>
How can we help?
<P>
One major drawback I noticed during my visits were the low usage
and awareness of Internet in Orissa. Even though NIC has 
facilities where by educational institutions can get free (almost)
Internet access, very few institutions have taken advantage of it.
Besides awareness, the major problem most institutions face
is the equipment: Not the computer which many have, but the modem.
One of OITS's major agenda is to change this state of affairs.
I would appeal to the readers of this article to help in this.
Please tell your friends, family and acquaintances about Internet.
If necessary, arrange with Dr. S. P. Mishra for a demo at one
of the sites where it is available. Buy a modem and/or a computer
for a school or college. There are some private ISP providers
in Orissa and many more will be coming within the next few months.
Arrange for email access for your family and friends back home.
Unless Orissa is more Internet aware we will be left behind.
<P>
I would like to arrange for cyberchats with prominent Orissans.
To start with it would be great if we could have Mr. Naveen Patnaik
and Mr. J. B. Patnaik (not necessarily at the same time)
chat with Oriyas in the cyberspace over  the Internet. I need 
contacts who can help me in convincing either or both of them to 
participate. The technology side of it can be taken care of without 
much difficulty.
<P>
I would urge people involved in IT aspects to help the educational
institutions in Orissa, particularly the govt ones. They seem
to me little behind in terms of IT infrastructure. (They normally
have the best faculty and students though.) While some
of the private engineering colleges now have Internet, none of the
govt engineering colleges have them. 
<P>
I think we can also help in terms of developing new courses,
programs, and revising current courses and programs. In particular,
the current MCA and B.Engg programs in Orissa (except perhaps the
the B.Engg programs at Berhempur University) need a thorough 
revision. Also, I feel that the B.A and B.Com programs should have
Hons and pass in Information Systems. I envision the B. Com (Hons) in 
Information Systems program to be similar to the Bachelor in
Information Systems programs offered in Business schools in the
USA. Any one interested in this aspect can contact me for more 
detailed information on how to go about it with the Orissa Universities
and Orissa government. Such programs will take IT more closer
to all corners of Orissa, not just to a handful of places. The 
UGC in India encourages new vocational courses and often funds
them. For example, the initial B.Sc in computer science program
at S.C.S. college in Puri came about due to a proposal submitted
by S.C.S. college to UGC. We should help colleges in such endeavors.
On the other hand people among us in  high tech and emerging 
areas such as biotechnology and environmental science and engineering
should help establish and/or support post graduate, Ph.D and research 
programs at the Orissa universities. 
<P>
We can also help in establishing training institutes that
train qualified people on emerging topics and help place the trained
personnel. For example, I have heard of training schools in 
Chennai that offer training in SAP for about Rs 1 lakh and are 
able to place their graduates in the USA. I know of one NRO who
discussed such a plan with the Orissa government. To
the best of my knowledge his ideas were warmly received by the
government (particularly, the chief secretary and the OSEDC MD)
and he was promised all help from them.
<P>
To conclude, I hope the examples in this article on how some
ideas were made realities and how the Orissa govt is receptive 
to good ideas from us are useful. I feel the Orissa government
as a whole is now a days very forward looking and accessible
to us. I can not imagine setting up an appointment with the 
governor or secretary of state of  Texas and discussing with him
on a plan to introduce a new curriculum. But, I could, with no
personal contacts and relationship, do it with the Orissa deputy 
CM, and chief secretary. One thing we need to remember is that the
state of Orissa is not flush with money. In fact their balance
is in bad shape. So when we discuss something which involves a 
lot of financial investment from the state it may be hard
to get it done. On the other hand if our plan involves help
from the state in terms of `kind' (not hard cash) then the state
will probably be more receptive. Hence, we should develop our ideas into
plans that does not require substantial cash investment from the state.
<P>
I would like to encourage the readers to come up with additional ideas 
and plans, discuss them in forums such as ornet and develop them 
into concrete documents, contact appropriate individuals and 
officials in Orissa, and proceed with its implementation. I personally
would be happy to help in any such endeavor. Looking forward
to an IT rich Orissa. Namaskar.
