<U>Preamble</U>
</FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
All of us know how Orissa has a vast mineral resources.
To be exact in terms of all-India reserves, it has 98%
of chromite, 70% of bauxite, 38% of graphite,
26% of iron ore and 23% of coal.      
It has adequate water, surplus power, and a large coast line of 480 kms.
One of the main reasons, there are not that many 
manufacturing industries, particularly the ones
that depend on minerals, in Orissa (for that matter around
the mineral Belt of Orissa-Bihar-W. Bengal)  
is because of the old freight policy 
of Indian Railways (which falls under the central govt.)
which charged transportation cost based on the
weight of the material transported, not on the distance. 
Thus, the closeness of Orissa was not an important factor.
Since these laws were changed in 1991, Orissa has been able
to attract several mining and manufacturing 
projects. (According to a presentation by Mr. Muthukrishnan of
TISCO who directs the project in Gopalpur Orissa is number ONE
in attracting new projects in mining and manufacturing
in last few years, in terms of the total investment.
)
<P>
Now that is all good. How about other other industries?
One of the other main focus of Orissa govt has been
software industries. The main resource for a software
industry is  trained human resources.
With very few B.Engg (Computer Sc) and MCA programs
Orissa does not have critical mass of this resource
<BR>

        The OSEDC (Orissa State Electronics Development Corp) is 
        aware of this and 
        has a separate proposal to set up
        an institute called Indian Institute of Information Technology
        - IIIT -- in Bhubaneswar, for many similar reasons. This proposal
        is complementary to the IIIT idea and will be positively
        affected by its creation.
	Besides, NASSCOM says, Companies have projected a
	demand for appx 41,000 software professionals each year
	between 1996 and 1998. With some 55,00 (total) new IT professionals
	entering the work force during this period, the job 
	market will remain tight. 
at this point.
It does not have or produce a large enough pool
of software professionals to be attractive to software companies.
(Bangalore had this resource because of the many 
Electronic related public
sectors -- such as ITI, BEL, ISRO, etc., 
and many many -- more than 20 -- private and govt Engineering
colleges there.)
To not miss the boat we have to act fast. But in these
days of liberalization we can not have more public sectors in Orissa,
and because of the huge cost factor we can not have too many new
engineering colleges. Thus we can not just copy Bangalore.
 We need to come up with an innovative, quick and cost conscious
approach.
The rest of this document provides such a model which I believe
will result in large scale availability of software trained human capital
in Orissa, thus making Orissa an extremely attractive place
for software related investment.

<P>
<FONT FACE="BRUSH SCRIPT MT"><FONT SIZE=+2>
<U>The main idea</U> 
</FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
The  main idea is to
develop B.Sc (Hons) computer Science programs
(perhaps in stages as dictated by the financial limitations of the
state) at colleges all   over Orissa where there are B.Sc (Hons)
in Mathematics and/or Physics programs with future goals}to
develop B.Com (Hons) in Information Systems programs across Orissa.
<P>
The modus operandi would be to limit costs by using existing
infrastructure, such as buildings, class rooms, etc
to the largest extent possible,
with additional cost involved only in
training Maths/Physics lecturers in Computer Science,
and  providing computer access, and hiring only one
new faculty with computer science background (perhaps
with an MCA or a M.Tech degree in computer science) for each
college.
<P> 
The innovativeness of developing B.Sc(Hons) computer
science programs  is that it minimizes additional
cost and it is broad based in the sense that it can be,
in stages, but fairly quickly,
introduced in large number of colleges across Orissa.
Unlike the currently existing MCA, and B.Engg (Computer Sc)
which can only be offered by universities and the PG granting colleges,
and Engineering colleges, thus limiting the number
of institutions that can offer these degrees, 
the B.Sc (Hons) degree in Computer
Science can be offered by a much larger number of colleges
all across Orissa that already offer B.Sc (Hons) degrees in
Physics and/or Mathematics.
<P>
A pilot/experimental program in a few (3-8) colleges
should be introduced as soon as possible.
This will make it easy to fund and start the program 
and will allow
time for the idea to sink in and correction 
of any oversights before it is
introduced in a larger pool of colleges.
</FONT>
<P>

<U>Disclaimer</U>
</FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
The rest of the document outlines
a possible implementation of the above idea. It is
not our intention to say that this is the only
way to implement the main idea and implementors in Orissa
are perfectly entitled to take ground realities into account
in making implementation decisions; but we request them that
they take the arguments and main points in this document into
account.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="BRUSH SCRIPT MT"><FONT SIZE=+2>
<U>Main Issues</U></FONT></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="BRUSH SCRIPT MT"><FONT SIZE=+1>
<U>Who will teach?</U></FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
The  main idea is to train 3-4
Physics and Mathematics lecturers from each college,
in Computer Science, so that they can teach the B.Sc(Hons)
courses in that college.
<P>
This will be much cheaper than hiring new computer science
faculty. Moreover, the average salary of computer scientists
in companies are so high that it would be difficult to get them
to be lecturers in colleges, where they will get paid much less,
because of the fixed salary slabs in colleges.
<P>
Also, private institution (such as NIIT) affiliates can not
in general be hired to do the teaching as the instructors there
are more trade oriented. I.e., they may know the usability
of software packages such as LOTUS or EXCEL, they are not
usually good at the basics of computer science, such as
`data structures, and `finite automata'.
Also, from a long term perspective it is better that
we develop a pool of well qualified lecturers in computer science.
<P>
Nevertheless, the core of 3-4 trained lecturers
could be supplemented with 1 new lecturer with a computer science
degree and 1-2 application oriented courses taught
by private institutions (or their affiliates).
<P>
subsection Ensuring quality of the trained teachers
The success of this proposal critically depends on
the quality of the students that will graduate with the
B.Sc (Hons) in Computer Science degree. 
This in turn critically hinges on how good their teachers
are, and this will depend on how well they are trained.
<P>

The main idea here is that
the selected Mathematics and Physics lecturers
are trained in Bhubaneswar,
Rourkela, Berhampur, Burla, and Sarang where there are existing
institutions with computer science faculty, who will be in
the trainer pool.
(CET, OEC, XIM, Dept of Computer Sc
and Application -- Utkal and OCAC in Bhubaneswar,
REC in Rourkela, NIT in Berhampur,  UCE in Burla,
and the Engineering college in Sarang.)
These instructors will be helped by a advisory
board of Computer Sc faculty from reputed institutions
in India and abroad. 
Also, in case that well qualified instructors are not
available locally, the government should
hire well qualified trainers from outside.
This investment will pay off in terms of better
trained lecturers which will result in 
well qualified graduating students.
<P>

To ensure the quality of the trained lecturers,
they will have to pass 
examination in each of the courses,
that they will be teaching. (Just attending will not 
make them eligible to teach.) Special efforts should be
made to ensure that the exam process is
corruption free so as to ensure the quality. 
<P>
</FONT>
<FONT FACE="BRUSH SCRIPT MT"><FONT SIZE=+1><U>Facilities
</U></FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
Initial facilities in terms of computers and softwares
will be provided by the Orissa govt, and later 
software companies and well-off alumni or
well wishers (particularly NRIs) will be approached
to donate individual computers (with their name as the domain
name, if they would like that)
or even to set up software labs bearing their names by
donating most computers and softwares in that lab.
(In the USA, a major source of income for colleges and universities
is through fund-raising from alumni, well-wishers, and local
businesses. This needs to be pursued with vigor.)
<P>
Initial physical facilities such as class rooms,
laboratory space etc., for the new B.Sc (Hons) 
program will be provided by the corresponding college.
<P>

The aim should be to have 1 computer for each five Computer Science
hons students
and 1 computer for each 10 computer science pass students.
(The government may consider charging Rs 5000 per year
for each hons students and Rs 2500 a year for each pass student,
as a computer usage fee, with waivers and/or loans  for students from
economically disadvantage background.
Here also, scholarships could be funded through fund-raising,
and people funding a particular scholarship will have the
scholarship named after them.) 
<P>

<FONT FACE="BRUSH SCRIPT MT"><FONT SIZE=+1><U> Affiliation and authorization issues</U></FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
For speedy implementation of this program, the program will
be designed so as not to depend on the Central Govt or the
All India Council of Technical Education.
<P>
The program will stress on the B.Sc (Hons) science aspect 
avoiding engineering so as not to require a certification
from the All India Council of Technical education.
<P>
The program will be formally certified from the Universities
in Orissa and classified as a B.Sc (Hons) program.
Since, the program will follow the current pattern
used in other B.Sc (Hons) programs and will not be
proposing any radical idea 
%(except the 4-yr with thesis 
%option which should be pursued separately at a non-emergency
%pace so as not to delay the implementation
%of the 3-yr program), 
it should not have problem in getting
approved by the University authorizing bodies.
<P>         
(I just found out from the Silicon India news magazine%
footnote{The exact news item is as follows:
``The Tamil Nadu Institute of Information Technology (Tanitec),a project
   which was announced in the 1997 Tamil Nadu budget, will be active in  
   education as well as research and development. It is also expected to
   play a catalytic role in making Tamil Nadu ' an intelligent state.'
   The committee headed by Mr. N. Vittal, former secretary, Department of
   Electronics (DoE), which was set up to prepare a blue print for the
   project, recently submitted its recommendations to the Chief Minister.
   The institution will have a high degree of autonomy since it is likely
   allocated Rs 100 million for the project in his Budget speech. The
   committee has recommended starting the B.Sc. (Information Science)
   course by June, 1998 and B.Tech. course by June 1999. The institute is
   likely to be located in the Anna University premises.
 ''}
that Tanitec -- Tamilnadu institute of information
technology -- is also proposing a B.Sc degree in 
Information Science, in addition
to B.Engg degree in Information Technology.)

 <U>The training program</U>
</FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
The training program has to be carefully designed with the
main goal being that the training produce competent/qualified
lecturers. (I was told that the 6 months training on Computers that
the Orissa govt has been current providing to
lecturers has not been very effective because of
not so good trainers, no examination for the trainees,
and no evaluation process for the trainers' teaching ability.)
 Because of the important role it plays in the success
of the whole plan, the training process should be handled by
an autonomous body without any outside interference.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="BRUSH SCRIPT MT"><FONT SIZE=+1><U> Selection of the lecturers for training</U></FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
Mostly, lecturers in Mathematics and Physics will
be trained. This is because the mathematical training
received by them during their B.Sc and M.Sc makes them
better prepared for computer science. In general 
a fair criteria, with little room for
corruption, should be used to 
decide on the lecturers that will be trained.
Some of the preference criteria that make sense are:

<OL>
<LI>Preferring lecturers with a Ph.D, as that indicates
their ability to self learn, and

<LI> Preferring lecturers in colleges that currently teach electronics
and/or computer science as 4th optional subjects in
+2 science and that teach the computer science paper
in the Math (Hons) programs.

</OL>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="BRUSH SCRIPT MT"><FONT SIZE=+1>
<U>Incentive for the lecturers
</U></FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
Various incentives should be provided to get the best lecturers.
Such incentives include salary increments and promotions.
But some of the other incentives that are also integral
in the training process may include, a computer for each
lecturer (that way he/she can do programming at home
and would make the training place flexible -- no need
to have a compute lab at the training center) and internet/email
access (to be in touch with computer science faculty all
over the world, particularly with the advisory board).
An alternative to individual computers to trainee lecturers
could be  giving  2-3 computers to the parent college of each trainee
that will be used by the 3-4 trainees from that college.
(This alternative may be more practical if computers
must be located in an A/C room.)
Also, the fact that being trained in
computer science gives the lecturers
opportunity to consult in computer companies, is an
incentive factor.
Finally, they will
be provided opportunity to do Ph.D in computer science at a 
later point.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="BRUSH SCRIPT MT"><FONT SIZE=+1><U>Training details
</U></FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
The basic training will be part-time for the first
3 semester and full-time in the 4th semester.
A suggested training break-up is as follows:
<P>
<OL>

<LI> First Six months:
(A1) Digital Circuits and
(B1) Structured programming (in Pascal).

<LI> Second six months:
(A2) Automata and formal languages and 
(B2) Data Structures and 
algorithms (in C).

<LI> Third six months:
(C1) Design and analysis of algorithms and (C2) numerical analysis and
(G) Object oriented programming with Java.

<LI> Fourth six months: One of the following combinations.
</OL>
<P>

(i)(D1) Databases and (D2) Artificial Intelligence and
($H_1$) Agents, workflows, and client-server computing  using Java.
<BR>
(ii) 
(E1) Operating Systems and (E2) Computer Architecture and
($H_2$) Introduction to networking and distributed systems.
<BR>
(iii)
(F) Compiler theory, system programming, LEX and YACC and
($H_3$) Graphics and multi-media.

<p>

The only restriction would be that lecturers from
each college will be equally distributed between the
three options in the last semester.

To ensure the quality of the training some of the
procedures that should be followed are:
<P>
(i)
The training should be conducted by an independent body
that will get the  best faculty from local institutions.
(For example, in Bhubaneswar the instructors could be
from OEC, CET, XIM or Utkal University.
The process of trainer selection should be judicious and fair
so as to get the best (in terms of knowledge and teaching ability)
trainers, and if qualified trainers are not available
locally, then they should be brought from outside.
(Note that the training location need not be fixed, and since the
lecturers -- trainees -- will have their own computer
a full-fledged computer lab in the training location
may not be necessary.)
<p>
(ii) To attract the best trainers, they should be paid well.
<p>

(iii)The trainers will be helped by the advisory board and
will be given real-time internet access (email, web browsing
and web server access).
<p>
(iv) Trainers will be evaluated by the trainees
after every course they teach. Trainers with bad evaluations
will not be have their contracts renewed.
<p>

The trainees must pass the exam in each of the courses
to be allowed to teach in their colleges.
During the training their teaching load will be
reduced (say halved) in their
parent college. 
  
Reputed faculty from abroad and India will be invited to 
teach during the summer, and software engineers/scientists
from industries will be invited once in a while to give short
courses on novel softwares.

</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="BRUSH SCRIPT MT"><FONT SIZE=+2><U>The 3 yr B.Sc (Hons) Computer Science program</U></FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
This will be a trend setting program where we demystify
computer science and make it widely available, and treat it
as a science degree not a technological degree. As mentioned before,
 the main advantage of this degree will be that being a
B. Sc (Hons) program it can be offered in a much larger number of
colleges as compared to MCA and B.Engg (Comp Sc) programs which
can only be offered in few colleges -- that are authorized to have
PG depts --  and universities and
engineering colleges respectively.
<P>
To be able to get speedy approval from the universities,
one of our goal would be that the B.Sc (Hons) Computer Science
program should be structurally as close as possible to the other
B.Sc (hons) programs that are currently available.
So first we review the structure of the current B.Sc (Hons) programs.
<P>
</FONT>
<FONT FACE="BRUSH SCRIPT MT"><FONT SIZE=+1><U>
The current B.Sc (Hons) programs
</FONT></FONT></U>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
Currently, B.Sc (Hons) programs have one Hons topic,
two pass topics and ancillary and foundation topics.
Also, the program is divided into three parts,
with one exam at the second year involving part 1 and 2
and another exam at the end of the third
year involving part 3.

<P>
In the Hons topic, there are 8 total papers, 2 paper each in part 1
and 2 and 4 in part 3.  There are 4 papers in each pass topic,
1 paper each in part 1 and 2 and 2 papers in part 3.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="BRUSH SCRIPT MT"><FONT SIZE=+1><U>
The regular 3-yr program</U></FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
As in case of the other B.Sc (Hons) programs this 
program will be for three years after +2.
Thus, to avoid possible delay in implementation, initially
no authorization from the All India Council of Technical Education
 will be sought.%
footnote{Note that many universities in US -- such as
the prestigious University of North Carolina -- offer
B.S in Computer science, even though, they do not offer any
engineering degree. Similarly,
in the prestigious University 
of Texas at Austin -- Computer Science is in the College of Science
and not in the College of Engineering. The college of engineering 
there has a separate program in Computer Engineering.}
<P>

The three year honors degree  will
be like any other existing B.Sc Hons degree in
its structure.  For the Computer Science Hons,
one of the pass subject must be Mathematics and the
other may be Physics or Chemistry. The details of the
pass subjects, and the ancillary and foundation subject
will remain unchanged. Hence, we now only discuss the
possible content of the eight Hons papers. They are as follows:
<OL>
<LI> Digital Circuits (A1) and Automata and formal languages (A2).
(50 marks each with a total of 100 marks. no practicals.)

<LI> Structured programming -- in Pascal (B1), Data structures
and Algorithms in C. (B2)
(30 marks each in B1 and B2 and 20 marks each for programming
practicals in B1 and B2.)

<LI> Algorithm analysis and design (C1) and Numerical analysis (C2)
(50 marks each with a total of 100 marks. no practicals.)

<LI> Databases (D1)  and Artificial Intelligence (D2).
(30 marks each in D1 and D2 and 20 marks each for programming
practicals in D1 and D2.)

<LI> Operating Systems (E1) and Computer Architecture (E2) 
(30 marks for the theory of E1, 20 marks for the practical of
E1, and 50 marks for the theory of E2.)

<LI> Compiler theory, system programming, LEX and YACC (F)
(60 marks theory and 40 marks practical.)

<LI> Object-oriented programming and Java (G)
(40 marks theory and 60 marks practical.)
</OL>
item Electives (H). One of the following:
<OL>

<LI> Agents, workflows, and client server computing using Java.($H_1$)
(40 marks theory and 60 marks practical)

<LI> Introduction to networking and distributed systems. ($H_2$)
(75 marks theory and 25 marks practical)

<LI> Graphics and multi-media. ($H_3$)
(50 marks theory and 50 marks practical.)
</OL>

Among these courses, 
Part I will consist of 
A (A1 and A2) and B (B1 and B2),
Part II will consist of
C (C1 and C2) and D (D1 and D2)
and Part III will consist of the rest.
But to decrease the load of teaching all of Part III in the
3rd year, G will actually be taught in the second year.
<P>
(It is hoped that the B.Sc program will start 6 months
after the start of the training of the lecturers.
The training program is designed accordingly, except that
for the first batch outside lecturers will be needed for
teaching (D1), as the lecturers will be getting
trained in (D1) at the same time. For all the other courses,
the training of the lecturers will precede the
teaching in the B.Sc (Hons) class.)
<P>
The program quality will be ensured through university
conducted  exams as in the other B.Sc (Hons) programs.
For the practicals, program portfolios will be
submitted to external evaluators who will
have responsibility of checking copying of programs
and giving have the grade.

The 4-yr B.Sc (Hons) with thesis program
</FONT></FONT></U>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
Although the B.Sc (Hons) Computer Science program will
be of three years, students will have the option to
do a thesis and two independent study courses in the fourth year 
to obtain an augmented degree which will be called
B.Sc (Hons) Computer Science (with thesis).
(An authorization by the All India Council of Technical education
for this 4-yr degree may be necessary.)
This degree will make it easier for
students to do higher studied abroad, particularly in the US,
where B.S degrees are of four years.
<P>

For the 4-yr with thesis option students need to pick
two topics (from the list in the previous section)
which were not electives
for independent study (but it will involve exams and
projects) and do a  thesis. They may
do this while working in a company.
<P>
 To not delay the implementation of the
core 3-yr program, this 
option should be pursued separately at a non-emergency
pace. Hence, it should not be a part of the initial proposal.
It should be only proposed after the 3-yr program is approved
and installed in a few colleges.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="BRUSH SCRIPT MT"><FONT SIZE=+2><U>
Selecting the students</FONT></FONT></U>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
The students for the B.Sc (Hons) program may be picked
based on their PCM marks in I.Sc. They must have at least 
55\% in these subjects though. (This will avoid the
extra hassle of an entrance exam and current policies
will be followed for transfer between 
depts and hons.)
Another possibility may be to use the current Orissa JEE for
engineering colleges and pick students from them.

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="BRUSH SCRIPT MT"><FONT SIZE=+2><U>
Relation with other programs</FONT></FONT></U>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
The other related programs that are
university approved are the B.E and B.Tech programs
in Computer Science (and Engineering), MCA programs
and M.Sc in Computer Science programs.
<P>
This program differs from the B.E and B.Tech programs
by staying away from Engineering. It differs from MCA
by being a science program with substantial theory
in comparison to the MCA program which focuses on applications.
<P>

This program will be like any other B.Sc program
with similar rules and policies, with minimal change
in case of the 4-yr with thesis option.
<P>

In comparison to the programs offered by private institutions
such as NIIT, ACE etc., this will be a legitimate program.
The 2-3 year PGDCA programs offered by these institutions
(particularly, in Orissa) are mostly money making ventures with
little regard to teaching. The lack of good teachers
footnote{Some affiliates in metros such as New Delhi
are pretty good. A friend of mine after taking NIIT course
in Delhi got a job in HCL. But I have not heard any such
success story in Orissa. The best I have heard is that
students after finishing their course work at NIIT
have got a teaching job at the same or a similar private
institution or a data entry job.}
and the absence of legitimate exams are the main reason
for the poor quality of the program offered by them.
Besides, the amount of money charged by them makes it
unaffordable to most.
<P>
But, they sometime offer good short courses in
particular software packages. As mentioned before,
a college may contract with them to teach such a
course as an elective.

The proposed IIIT can take over the training role
once it is established and can serve as a central node
between the various B.Sc (Hons) granting colleges and the

The competition from the B.Sc (Hons) programs will provide
impetus for the institutions granting B.E (Computer Sc)

Real time Internet access will have a major impact on this.
(For example, in US professors are paid by the university 
only for the  non-summer months. In the summer months, they
are free to pursue other activities on their own,
and many grant agencies that fund summer research do not
require the professor to be physically located in the US.
This means many of the Oriya computer science professors
can come to Orissa in the summer and do  research and teaching there.
But, they would do that only if they have real-time internet access
through which they will be in touch with the day to day activity
of their students and research colleagues in US.
I personally will be very happy to spend 2 months in the
summer teaching and doing research in Orissa every 2-3 years; 
but again, only if I am given real-time internet access
from Bhubaneswar to my computers in the US.
Similarly, Oriya computer scientists working in the US
would also spend more time in Orissa and would help out 
through short -- 1 week -- courses if they are provided
internet access.)

Internet
</U></FONT></FONT>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
As mentioned in the previous section, 
having real-time internet access from Orissa is extremely 
important for the success of this program.
It  will also enable  fast communication between the instructors,
the lecturers and the advisory board members which is critical
to the success of this program.
Moreover, the World Wide Web accessible through the internet is
like a virtual library and access to it would mean less
expense in terms of setting up full blown computer science
sections at libraries in
the different colleges.}
<P>
If there is a delay in expanding the govt networks such as the
VSNL, NIC etc. to colleges and institutions,
then private internet providers should
be enticed, perhaps with a 2 year contract for real-time internet
connections at several colleges and institutions.

Training 32 lecturers\footnote{Besides the computers,

<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
If setting up the training requires time, and we need to start
right away, then another alternative would be immediately start
the B.Sc (Hons) Computer science program in
few (3-4) colleges by hiring MCA graduates as lecturers
for that college, and then following-up with the
training plan for expanding the program to other colleges.

Computer Science Pass
</FONT></FONT></U>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
Students doing  B.A (Hons) in mathematics
or B.Sc (Hons) in non-computer science subjects
could take computer science as a pass subject, where 
they will be required to take four computer
science papers (A, B, D and E).
This will lead to combinations such as:
<OL>
<LI> Mathematics (Hons), Physics and Computer Science pass.

<LI> Physics (Hons), Mathematics and Computer Science pass.

<LI> Chemistry (Hons), Mathematics and Computer Science pass.

<LI> Botany (Hons), Zoology and Computer Science pass.

<LI> Zoology (Hons), Botany and Computer Science pass.

Such combinations are  important because more and more physical scientists
and biologists have to know how to use computers.
For example, biologists working on gene sequencing
need to know the basics of computer science.
In fact many of the Oriya  physical scientists/biologists
in the US do a considerable amount of programming.

B.A. and B.Com programs

<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
The idea of B.Sc (Hons) in Computer Science
will be extended to have B.A and B.Com (Hons) in
Computer Application and
Information Systems by training Commerce and Arts lecturers
with suitable background. These two programs will be very
similar and focus more on application programming and less
on the underlying theory (where Mathematics plays a critical
role).

The M.Sc Computer Science program at the Universities,
such as the one in Utkal University,
will be impacted by the B.Sc (Hons) program.
They would have to be upgraded, with better and larger

make them really good programs.
(While students with the 3-yr B.Sc Hons Computer science degree
will be eligible only for the M.Sc Computer science program, the
students with the 4-yr B.Sc (Hons) with thesis degree
will also be eligible for the M.Tech in Computer Science programs.)

Possible Criticisms/Questions and Responses to them
</FONT></FONT></U>
<FONT FACE="FIXEDSYS">
<OL>
 <LI> 
Q: Will it be easy to train Math/Physics lecturers in Computer Science?
Also, from the students perspective is it easy to learn computer science?
 <P>
Ans: It is not easy, but it is doable with enthusiastic
participants and a well-designed program.  Most lecturers
I encountered during my ISc in 81-83 were pretty good,
and in the US and many other places most early Computer Science
professors were converted Mathematicians/Physicists/Electrical Engineers.

<P>
From the students point of view, I can say that Computer Science
is not some elite subject which only a chosen few can do.
In fact it is sometimes easier than Maths and Physics.
(I have been  the head of the graduate
program in Computer Sc at the University of Texas at El Paso
for last 5 years, and during those years I have had students
from all kinds of backgrounds -- from civil engg to Physics
to Maths, who have gone through leveling courses
and then done their MS in Computer Sc, and then joined
prestigious Software firms in the US.)
<P>
<LI> 
Q. Are 3-4 lecturers in each college enough?

<P>
Ans. Enough to start.
Initially, each lecturer would have to learn the equivalent of the
leveling and basic courses -- there are 4 such courses
at our university, and learn 4  of the later courses.
That means in each college each of these 3-4 lecturers
can teach the basic courses and they can teach about
8-10 advanced courses. That would be enough for a B.Sc (Hons)
in Computer Science.
 <P>
<LI>
Q: Won't the lecturers leave and join some company.
<P>

Ans. Many of them are settled and probably won't leave.
%Perhaps they can sign a bond to not leave for certain number
%of years. 
Also, after the training
they will have good conceptual knowledge with some
programming experience; they won't be
expert programmers. It is the later
who are sought after by the companies.
(In general people who have been teachers
do not normally like to join a company.)
<P>

Some lecturers may leave for higher study though.
In fact this should be encouraged by the govt, as this will
not only produce more qualified computer scientists with ties to
Orissa, but also serve as an attraction to go through the
training.
%with
%appropriate measures to ensure they come back for a
%certain number of years.
<P>

 <LI>
Q: Where will the students find the job?
(I was told about 50\% of the Computer Science graduates of
Orissa Engineering College in BBSR, have difficulty in finding jobs.)

<P> 
Ans. Recall the NASSCOM statement about current and anticipated 
demand of IT professionals. If some graduates have not found 
a job, it is probably because they have limited their search area.
They could easily find jobs if they went to metros or
Bangalore and stayed there and looked for jobs.
This is because many companies prefer local talent
because of the cost/hassle of interviewing out of town applicants.
(CS graduates in US know this very well.)
<P>

We can not wait till enough companies are there in
BBSR/Orissa to start new CS programs. This is because
the companies will come only after there are enough 
CS professionals around. So, even if there is not
enough demand for IT professionals in BBSR now, we 
still need to go ahead with this proposal.
Initially, the CS graduates who could not find job in
BBSR  will go to the metros and Bangalore. But
soon more and more companies will come to Orissa because of
this availability of human capital. Also, hopefully some
of the graduates will return and set-up their own companies.
<P>
<LI>
  
Q. What about the private institutions such as NIIT etc that have
opened shop in urban centers of Orissa.

<P>
Ans. From my experience, because of the lack of good teachers
they are pretty bad in Orissa. (In Metro towns
with educated IT professionals teaching part-time
some of them are pretty good.)
<P>

But, many of these institutions, in their attempt to protect
their turf may put political pressure
against the idea of B.Sc (Hons) Computer Sc in colleges
across Orissa, and create problems.
 
<P>
Our political leadership has to overcome this.
<P>

Some kind of partnership between them  and individual colleges
in terms of using their facilities (particularly computers)
for the lab classes may be formed for short durations.
But this  may trigger corruption
in terms of lucrative contracts; so this has to be done properly.
<P>
<LI> 
Q: But the trend now is towards privatization,
    not more govt spending in secondary education.

<P>
Ans. I sincerely hope the well-off Oriyas and
Software companies come to the rescue in
reducing the investment by the government.
The government may also decide to charge computer usage
fees for Computer science honors and pass students.
 <P>
<LI>

Q: How about the quality of these programs?
<P>
Ans:  
The B.Sc exams conducted by the university will
ensure some degree of quality.
But overall, the quality of these programs will
critically depend on the training imparted to the
lecturers and the facilities made available
at the colleges. This should be taken very seriously, 
as it does not serve any purpose to graduate 
unqualified students who are overlooked by the
software industry, thus giving a bad name to the
whole program.
<P>
<LI>
Q: How about focusing on a really good institution
instead of many many not so good institution.
<P>

Ans: 
The idea of having an IIT quality Information
Technology institute, such as the proposed IIIT in Bhubaneswar
is an excellent goal. Bhubaneswar and Orissa does need
a top quality information technology institute
graduating to quality computer scientists.
But together with the IIIT, we also need to have
broad based programs that can be easily  duplicated
in all nooks and corners of Orissa. The proposed
B.Sc (Hons) in Computer Science program is such a program.

<P>
The goal of this proposal is to provide opportunity to
a broad segment of the population; not just for a chosen few.
Also, the vision is to not just to make Bhubaneswar a software city,
but to make Orissa a software state.
