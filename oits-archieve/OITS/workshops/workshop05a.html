Here there were about 33 participants from all over orissa. They were mostly
faculty members, with some m.tech students with an inclination to join as
faculty when they pass out.
</p><p>
The workshop was inaugurated by Professor D Acharya, Vice-Cancellor, 
Biju Patnaik University of Technology.
</p><p>
The resource personnel included S Padhy, A K Das, B N B Ray and Ajit
Nayak who gave lectures as well as supervised experience of the participants
in the laboratory.
</p><p>
 The workshop included practical demonstrations as needed.
Ajit kumar Nayak, Silicon Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar,
demonstrated in all afternoon sessions about hands on experience of the
techniques.
</p><p>
This workshop had the unique distinction in being functional truly as
a workshop, with the participants normally working for ten to twelve hours
a day to update themselves both theoretically and otherwise. This workshop
made us believe that the problem of faculty improvement can be seriously
tackled within available resources.
</p><p>
The financial contribution of oits to this workshop was Rs.12,000/-, with
Rs.5000/- being a block grant, and the balance being towards subsidisation
of registration fees of oits members and some students.
