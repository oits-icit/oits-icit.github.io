         SUBSIDISATION PATTERN FOR THE WORKSHOPS UNDER QIP
</b>
</center>
</p>
<p>
The following pattern for financial assistance for workshops under the
quality improvement program (QIP) was decided:
</p>
<p>
Workshops for a period of four days or more will have a block subsidisation
of Rs.6,000/-; those for three days will have this amount as Rs.5,000/-;
those for two days or less will have the same as Rs.3,000/-.
</p>
<p>
The registration fees for the participants can not be more than Rs.1,200/-
for four days or more, and, can not be more than Rs.1,000/- for three days
workshops.
</p>
<p>
OITS life members not supported by their institutions will have over and
above the block grant, a subsidisation of half of the registration fees
from oits. The other half is to be paid by the participants to the organisers.
However, it was decided on 20.12.2006 that the number here shall not exceed
ten. Those desirous of availing this may email to the presiden, oit
(spadhy04@yahoo.co.in).
</p>
<p>
Subsidisation for M.Tech. students, who are almost would be teachers in
computer science, however, shall be as decided separately by the organisers.
</p>
<p>
The organisers are required to submit the program, along with a report on
the workshop immediately after the completion of the workshop, as a soft
copy mailed to spmisra1@sancharnet.in for including in the website.
