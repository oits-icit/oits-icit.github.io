         A lecture series on Advanced Computer Architecture and Parallel
     Computing was conducted in Utkal University under the auspices of Orissa
     Information Technology Scociety (OITS) and M.Tech. in Computer Science
     Program of Utkal University coordinated by Prof S Padhy. The daily 
     program was as follows:

         The morning programs were from 5th to 9th, August, 2002 and
     covered the topics: pipeline architecture and hazards, instruction level
     parallelism, software pipeline, scoreboard, terminal's algorithms,
     branch production, parallel processing architectures, shared memories,
     cache coherence, CC-NUMA, network processors.
</p>
<p>
         There was also a summary of current research, and a talk/discussions
     on admission for advanced study in USA in computer science. We are very
     happy to mention that Prof Bhuyan has sent a mail to many people 
     mentioning that he was quite happy to have delivered the lectures.

         Three afternoons were taken by D D Sanvone and K Bhatt, scientists 
     from BARC, Mumbai, who talked about anupam supersomputer, about MPIi, and 
     took tutorials on MPI. Fourth afternoon contained some discussions on 
     parallel algorithms by Prof S Padhy and about applications to 
     biotechnology by D Jena.
</p>
<p>

         The lecture series was inaugurated by Prof Pandav Nayak, Vice-
     Chancellor, Utkal University. About 120 participants registered, of
     which 54 were from outside Utkal University, and included participants
     from Berhampur and Dhenkanal, and many other places. We are thankful to 
     Dr. R K Chowdhury, Director, IOPB for inviting and taking care of the 
     scientists from BARC for participation in the lecture series.

         The ten lectures of Prof Bhuyan and the same by scientists from
     BARC, which include talks on Anupam and lectures and tutorials on MPI 
     have been written to a CD, and will be available from Prof S P Misra
