<font size=3>
</p><p>

         A lecture series on Advanced Computer Architecture and Parallel
     Computing was conducted in Utkal University under the auspices of Orissa
     Information Technology Scociety (OITS) and M.Tech. in Computer Science
     Program of Utkal University coordinated by Prof S Padhy. The daily 
     program was as follows:
</p><p>
         The morning programs were from 5th to 9th, August, 2002 and
     covered the topics: pipeline architecture and hazards, instruction level
     parallelism, software pipeline, scoreboard, terminal's algorithms,
     branch production, parallel processing architectures, shared memories,
     cache coherence, CC-NUMA, network processors.
</p><p>
         There was also a summary of current research, and a talk/discussions
     on admission for advanced study in USA in computer science. We are very
     happy to mention that Prof Bhuyan has sent a mail to many people 
     mentioning that he was quite happy to have delivered the lectures.
</p><p>
         Three afternoons were taken by D D Sanvone and K Bhatt, scientists 
     from BARC, Mumbai, who talked about anupam supersomputer, about MPIi, and 
     took tutorials on MPI. Fourth afternoon contained some discussions on 
     parallel algorithms by Prof S Padhy and about applications to 
     biotechnology by D Jena.
</p><p>
         The lecture series was inaugurated by Prof Pandav Nayak, Vice-
     Chancellor, Utkal University. About 120 participants registered, of
     which 54 were from outside Utkal University, and included participants
     from Berhampur and Dhenkanal, and many other places. We are thankful to 
     Dr. R K Chowdhury, Director, IOPB for inviting and taking care of the 
     scientists from BARC for participation in the lecture series.
</p><p>
         The ten lectures of Prof Bhuyan and the talks by scientists from
     BARC, which include talks on Anupam and lectures and tutorials on MPI 
     have been written to a CD, and will be available from Prof S P Misra 
     (tel: 440810) at bbsr for any oits member, or any body else ineterested
     in the same.

          ORISSA INFORMATION  TECHNOLOGY OLYMPIAD
</center>
</p><p>
<center>
               Held on 1st September, 2002
</center>
</font>
</p><p>
 
 Orissa Information Technology Society (OITS) conducted a quiz test at
senior (MCA, BE, B.Sc.(Eng) and B.Sc.(hons)) and junior (upto class XII)
levels with separate questions, on 1st September, 2002. We contacted 
Berhampur, Puri, Sambalpur/Burla, Rourkela, Sarang, Cuttack, Raygada, Baripada
and Bhubaneswar.  About 1100 students registered for the same, and around 
one thousand students appeared. Organisationally, the contest was modelled 
the  same way as last year. This year there was a very positive response
from Rourkela, Sambalpur/Burla, Raygada and Baripada as additional venues. 
But the response from Berhampur decreased as many students had 
examinations.  Professor Sudarshan Padhy, Secretary, OITS mainly coordinated 
this activity, with able assistance from Dr. S.K. Sahu, Sambalpur, Dr. A.K. 
Otta, Sc College, Rourkela, Dr. B Majhi, NIT, Rourkela, P.K. Behera, Treasurer, 
OITS, and, Dr. Manas Patra and  V.K. Das from Berhampur. Also many others, 
including M.Tech. (Comp Sc) students, who were not eligible to contest, and  
young faculty members, came forward to help. The results at senior and junior 
levels are as below.
</p><p>

The format for conduct of the same and the results are available in the
web site <a href="olympiad/index.html">olympiad.</a>

          OLYMPIAD PRIZE DISTRIBUTION 
</center>
<center>
held on 24th November.
</center>
</font>
</p><p>
  In the olympiad, 11 students at the senior level, and the same number of 
students at the junior level were given prizes on 24th november, 2002. 
Dr. R.K. Chowdhury, Director, Institute of Physics, attended the function as the
Chief guest and, Dr. A.K. Pujari was the chief speaker. Almost all the senior
level prize winners attended. The junior level prize winners were requested
to attend with their guardians, and most of them also attended. A large number
of OITS members also attended to encourage the recipients. Dr. Pujari gave
an inspiring talk as an overview of IT. After the lecture we had an interactive
session of about an hour with all the participants, where all the students
were encouraged to ask questions, and the experts present were giving
brief answers.
</p><p>
  It was also announced that the first three winners at the senior level in
the olympiad were invited to attend cit2002 with all the benefits of delegates,
free of any registration charge. They were
</p><p>
1. Roshan Kumar Ganatra: NIST, 6/7th Semester BE  (CSE)
</p><p>
2. Smita  Pattnaik, College of Eng, bbs, 7th Semester BE  (CSE)
</p><p>
3. Amaresh  Mohapatra, Ravenshaw College, cuttack, 3rd  Semester  M.Sc.  (CS)
</p><p>
The first student could not attend as he had examinations on those days, but
the other two did attend the conference. The names of all the prize winners
in <a href="olympiad/index.html">olympiad</a> occurs separately.

 21st dec to 24th december, 2002.
</center>
</p><p>

   For cit2002 the main sponsors were Avaya Labs, USA, and Satyam Computer 
Services, India. There were also seven sponsors from orissa, six of them from 
Bhubaneswar. On 21st december, in all these six institutions, seven tutorials
were held. About 500 students and faculty attended these 
<a href="cit2002/tutorials02.html"> tutorials </a>. The 
feed back from the tutorial teachers was that the response of those who
attended was quite good. Most of the tutorial teachers came for the
conference, and the local fall out in this regard (one of the objectives
of oits) was satisfying.
</p><p>
   The main academic <a href="cit2002/program.html"> program </a> was 
held from 22nd to 24th in hotel marrion.
Every day the attendance was between 120 to 130 (or may  be  more). 
On 24th, in the last session of the last day of the conference the attendance 
was about 80%, which is quite a good attendance in any serious conference. 
The satisfying  feature was that the attendance was more for the conference, 
and sight seeing became secondary. A special interactive session in the 
Conference evoked a lot of interest of young scientists and generated
their interaction with the senior scientists. 
</p><p>
   There were three awards given at the conference. The first two, the
avay labs, usa award, and the satyam awards, each of Rs.5,000/-, were given
to the two best papers. Besides this, S.P. Misra donated a sum of Rs.45,000/-
to oits for Narayan Misra IT award, which this year was awarded to the
best paper from contributions from orissa. Purnendu Sinha of concordia
university, canada, and Basabi Chakraborty from Aizu Un. of Japan won the
two best paper awards, and Rakesh Agarwal of Infosys won the Narayan Misra
IT award.

5. We now give the accounts of oits for the year 2001-2002 as prepared by
the Treasurer.

Thus, balance on 31st March, 2002 is:   Rs.3,13,837.03
</p><p>

This consists of:
</p><p>

(a)  Fixed deposits of Rs.3,02,176/- with details as below:
</p><p>

(i)One fixed deposit of Rs.25,000/- with number as 415354.
</p><p>
(ii)One fixed deposit of Rs.31,566/- with number as 912825
</p><p>
(iii)Five fixed deposits on 29.6.2001 of Rs.27.857/- each with numbers 
as 912826-30 for fifteen months each with a total of Rs.1,39,285/-.
</p><p>
(iv)Fixed deposit no. 912867 for Rs.31,325/- Rs.25,000/ with total Rs.75,000/- 
</p><p>
(v)Fixed deposit nos. 912868-69 for Rs.50,000/- and
</p><p>

(b)  An effective amount in the Syndicate bank account
  (no.475) of Rs.10,573.03
</p><p>

(c)  Cash in hand of Rs.1088.00
</p><p>

This account has been duly audited by a chartered accountant, as in all 
previous years.
</p><p>

6. From april 2002 to december 2002 there have been ten new members, two of 
whom are donor members. The residual money with OITS at present is about 
Rs.4,10,000/-. Accounting and payment of bills for cit2002 is continuing; 
the balance of money to oits may be large.  
</p><p>

   Last year has been a very active  year for OITS. It is remarkable that
so  many  members of oits, and many outside oits, spread out throughout
Orissa and outside, had closely collaborated for the success of the programs.
</p><p>
   We have also made a copy of (a) the lectures of Prof Bhuyan and of experts
from TIFR, (b) all the tutorials and talks (keynote and
invited) and papers which won awards as available, and (c) some special 
lectures on networking and security by Prof Sanyal of TIFR delivered at
KIIT, into a CD. This shall be partly complementary to the 
Proceedings. The CD will be made available free to any oits member, or any 
one else asking for it.
</p><p>

7. Any suggestion for further improvements by any member or others, shall
be most welcome.
