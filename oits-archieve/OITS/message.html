The Orissa Information Technology Society intends organising an
International Conference on Information Technology'98 in  Bhubaneshwar
during 21-23 December'98. Though several Information Technology related
Conferences are organised in India every year, it was felt that
organisation of such a Conference in Bhubaneswar will accelerate the
growth of the academic, research, and development activities in the IT
sector in Orissa. Such a Conference will bring together leaders from
the academic, research, and industry sectors and create an environment
for healthy professional interaction among the attendees of the
Conference. It is hoped that young IT professionals of Orissa,
particularly the students and the future IT leaders of Orissa, will be
immensely benefitted through such an interaction. For the overall
growth of IT sector, the organisers of the Conference feel that such an
activity will act as a catalyst. Moreover, the Conference will  attempt
to bring together on a common platform leaders  having links with
Orissa who have distinguished themselves in their individual sphere of
specialisation in the broad discipline of Information Technology.
Needless to mention that IT as a discipline needs to be vigorously
nurtured with the zeal of mission in Orissa.
<P>
With these broad objectives, a group of enthusiastic Oriya IT
professionals have taken steps to establish the Orissa Information
Technology Society, with its founder President as Prof. Siba Prasad
Misra, an outstanding Mathematician and Physicst, dedicated to the
growth of Science in general and IT in particular, in Orissa.
<P>
It has been my fortune and privelege to convince a group of dedicated
committee members who have been doing an excelled job in helping me to
put together this exciting Conference. The pleasure has been mine in working
with them. May I request the global Oriya community in general and the OSA
convention attendees in particular, to give wide publicity to this event,
participate and contribute to the growth of this significant activity in
Orissa?
<P>
My warmest personal greetings and regards to you all. Wish you all an
exciting time and fun at the OSA Convention.
<P>
Hope to see you in large numbers at the ICIT 98 Conference in Bhubaneswar.
<P>
Sincerely
<P>
Lalit M Patnaik<BR>
General Chair, ICIT'98
