Cuttack and Bhubaneswar are twin cities with a population of 
approximately one million. Cuttack, the ex-capital of Orissa is home to
Ravenshaw College, one of the oldest educational
institutions in India, several engineering colleges,
a medical college, an engineering school, and several
IT professional training schools. Bhubaneswar, the current
capital of Orissa is home to Utkal University,
Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology, several
Engineering Colleges (College of Engineering and Technology,
KIIT, C. V. Raman, etc.), several  MCA (Master in Computer
