 Orissa Information Technology Society (OITS) conducted the annual quiz test at
senior (MCA, BE, B.Sc.(Eng) and B.Sc.(hons)) and junior (upto class XII)
levels with separate questions, on 7th September, 2003. The test, to be held
on the last sunday of august or the first sunday of september, was originally

there on that day. We contacted Berhampur, Puri, Sambalpur/Burla, Rourkela, 
Sarang, Cuttack, Raygada, Balasore, Damanjodi, Paradeep, Angul
and Bhubaneswar.  About 1200 students registered for the same, and around 
eleven hundred students appeared. This year there was a very positive response
from Rourkela, Sambalpur/Burla, Raygada and Balasore and some other places 
as additional venues. Prof Sudarshan Padhy, Coordinator, IT Olympiad mainly 
organised this activity, and he was ably assisted by many volunteers
including M.Tech. (Comp Sc) students (they were not eligible to contest) and  
young faculty members. The results at senior and junior levels are as below.

<p>
</p>
<p>
The IT olympiad prize distribution function was held on 18th January, 2004
at 2.30 pm. The Chief Guest was Bikramjit Maitra, Head, Infosys Centre at
Bhubaneswar, and the guest of honour was Gautam Parija, administrative
head, Infosys Centre, Bhubaneswar. Arun Samantaray, Administrator, Utkal
University, presided over the function. All the prize winners, along with
their teachers were invited to the function. Also, the parents of the prize
winners at junior level were separetely invited. There were altogether
about 70 to 80 participants.
</p>
<p>

The president of oits, S P Misra, welcomed the participants. Next Sudarshan
Padhy, Coordinator, IT olympiad program, spoke about the conduct of the
olympiad examination, and referred to the fact that on this occasion  there
were about nineteen centres in  which the students appeared, spread all over
Orissa.
</p>
<p>

Prizes were distributed by the Chief Guest, Bikramjit Maitra. In the
senior category, the first, second and third rank examinees were given
cash prizes of Rs.3,000/-, Rs.2,000/- and Rs.1,000/- respectively, and
consolation prizes of Rs.500/- each for the remaining eight examinees 
above, along with certificates. In the junior category, also the first, 
second and third rank examinees were given cash prizes of Rs.3,000/-, 
Rs.2,000/- and Rs.1,000/- respectively, and consolation prizes of Rs.500/- 
each for the remaining nine examinees, along with certificates. Most of
the prize winners took these prizes, and for those who were absent, the
amounts along with the certificates were sent by courier.
</p>
<p>

The Chief Guest addressed the gathering emphasizing the relevance of IT in
all phases of our Society. He also mentioned that Infosys has always wanted
to increase the number of selected candidates from Orissa, if they
satisfy minimal norms needed for it. He mentioned that parallel
to Olympiad tests, the selection process in Infosys takes  into account
not only the background knowledge of the candidates, but also their
ability to think and adapt themselves to learn new techniques in computer
science. Gautam
Parija also emphasized that for selection in Infosys the ability of candidates 
as such shall always be as important  as the knowledge they have already 
acquired.
</p>
<p>

Arun K Samantarai, Administrator, Utkal University also focussed on the  role
of IT in Society. He particularly emphasized the need  for closer collaboration
with industry to make such programs a success. While all lauded this activity
of oits, Sri Samantarai emphasized that assistance could be sought from
Industry for such programs.
</p>
<p>

S P Misra emphasized on two aspects for an extension of the  Olympiad
activity. (i) He mentioned that there is an attempt to coordinate this
activity with a similar activity at all India level, so that they can avail
of international competetion, and that (ii) from next year we may 
have a short training program of the best students appearing in the olympiad.
On behalf of Infosys Mr. Maitra assured that help for this can be available
from them.
</p>
<p>

There  was then  a tea break, after which like  last year an  interactive
session was conducted in the presence  of Bikramjit  Maitra and Gautam Parija.
Here students asked  many questions, which were mainly answered  by the 
visitors, along with  open house discussions participated by many experts
and students.
</p>
<p>

The meeting ended with a vote of thanks by Ajit Nayak, treasurer, oits as
the secretary was absent.

</p>
<p>
       inaugurated on 29.11.2003
</left>
</b>
</p>
<p>

In october 2003, about eleven oits members from sambalpur area wanted that
we may open the sambalpur chapter of oits. The president then located the
earlier members around sambalpur area, and also  asked some members outside
orissa whether they would like to join this chapter. The executive committee
which met on 16.11.2003 then approved that we may open this chapter as
per article 6 of the bylaws, and convenor for this chapter, B Patel of
G M College, sambalpur was intimated accordingly.
</p>
<p>

The chapter was formally inaugurated by Prof M C Dash, vice-chancellor, 
sambalpur university, in  a function at G M College premises on 29.11.2003.
Prof Arun Pujari, of hyderabad university, was the chief speaker. He gave
an illuminating semi-technical talk on artificial intelligence. The
Secretary, Dr B Patel talked about the interesting programs that were there
during cit2003, and also about the future programs of the sambalpur
chapter. Principal G M College was the guest of honour, and S P Misra,
president, oits, presided over the function. Prof Pujari had also given
a technical talk before the inauguration meeting.
</p>
<p>

The chapter began with a seed money of Rs.10,800+Rs.8,000, with the first
being from the registration fees of fourteen members, and, the second being 
a donation  by S P Misra, as he had a speial attachment to sambalpur
as his father, Prof Narayan Misra was the first principal of G M College, 
which was the beginning of higher education in that area.
The name of the account of sambalpur chapter is oits-sbp.
</p>
<p>

The Secretary has subsequently intimated that the following are the 
office bearers of the chapter:
</p>

</p><p>

Here 141 delegates had registered for the workshop. Out of them, there were 10 
life members of OIT-sbp, 13 faculties from nearby colleges, rest being 
students from different branches like MCA, Engnieering. Msc comp. sc., Physics,
Mathematics, Botany and Life Sciences.
</p><p>
Professor Sudarsan Padhy, Utkal University, Vanivihar
delivered talks on parallel computing in three different sessions.
</p><p>
On 22.03.04, in the first session he illustrated the same through different 
examples like weather forecasting, image processing etc. emphasizing the 
importance of Parallel Alogorithms over serial Algorithms,
and, taking different examples developed the problems on Parallel Algorithm.
In the second
Session some more developements in the problems of parallel alogorithms
  with multiprogramming and multi processing systems were considered.
</p><p>

 The uniqueness in the workshop was practical demonstrations as needed.
Ajit kumar Nayak, Silicon Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar,
demonstrated in two different sessions about clustering of different
work stations through Linux with the syntax to write programs using MPI.
The programmes were demonstrated to the students. This approch creates 
a lot of 
interest among the students for the problems of parallel algorithms.
</p><p>
There were Two Tea Breaks and One lunch break for all the delegates.
</p><p>

On 23.03.04
Professor Padhy developed the problems of parallel algorithms and proved 
the results.
</p><p>

Ajit Kumar Nayak  demonstrated more programs of parallel algotithms
 to the delegates.
</p><p>
 In the after noon session Prof Padhy delivered a talk on Bio-Informatics
which was followed by another talk from Prof A.P.Dash, G.M.College.
There were two Tea Breaks and one lunch for all the delegates.
</p><p>
 A feed back Form were circulated to all deligates and their views were
collected, which was enthusiastic and positive.
</p><p>
The main feature of this workshop was its multidisciplinary nature with the
delegates also belonging to diverse disciplines.

 E.           Opening of ROURKELA CHAPTER
</font>
</left>
</b>
</p>
<p>

In late december, 2003, a letter was received from Prof Sourya Patnaik,
director, rourkela institute of management studies (rims)
with a list of ten new members from rims along with a request to open a 
chapter of oits at rourkela. The Institute was rated as among the top 40 
B-schools, and had MCA programs along with business school programs. We 
already had quite  a  few oits  members in nit rourkela, and it was thought 
that such chapter shall be serving  the  aims and objectives of oits for 
the spread of IT in orissa.
</p>
<p>

S Patnaik and sreekumar both of rims acted as convenors of the chapter. They 
further requested that they already had a program for faculty improvement 
scheduled for 8th January, 2004, and it would be nice to inaugurate the 
rourkela chapter of oits then with the faculty improvement program being the 
first function under its auspices. However, as per rules oits executive 
committee needs  to approve the opening of a chapter for which time was not
available. Since opening of this chapter was  totally parallel to  the
opening of the sambalpur chapter, the president rang up some executive
committee members, and with their approval intimated Prof Patnaik that we may 
do so.
</p>
<p>

The chapter was inaugurated on 8th january, 2004 by again, Prof M C Dash,
vice-chancellor, sambalpur university. The function was attended by the
president, oits, who welcomed the delegates, by Prof S Padhy, who spoke
about IT and oits, Prof G Panda, who elaborated on many aspects of IT to 
emphasize that IT is so interdisciplinary that it could hardly be regarded
as an  independent subject. Prof Sourya  Patnaik presided  over the function
and intimated that they had requested Prof Panda of NIT Rourkela to be the 
president of the chapter and he had kindly agreed.
</p>
<p>

One  thing about Prof Panda's  talk particularly impressed me. He said
that he can train computer students to be self-reliant and through
software development, through this training,  earn their own livelihood
at a comfortable level. I do hope that through his leadership, this will
come to happen, in which case  rourkela  chapter will lead oits and all
IT lovers about a very positive action.
</p>
<p>

The afternoon programe was devoted to the workshop on financial computation
where  an expert from finance introduced the subject, and Prof Padhy talked
about the computational modelling of the corresponding theories. It was
attended by more than twenty-five participants spread from different colleges
in orissa. It is very well known that economic models have  become highly
mathematical, and with the  need  for wide-scale data bases, computational
finance is  becoming a very important area of IT.
</p>
<p>

The executive committee of oits met on 12.1.2004 where it discusssed about 
the opening of the rourkela chapter, and approved the same.
</p>
<p>

Rourkela chapter started with the seed money of Rs.11,210+Rs.8,000, the
first above being the money transferred from oits membership fees, and
the second being a donation by S P Misra, who was Professor at (then)
REC Rourkela for ten years. He also thought that the amount should be
reasonable, since as per rules at least half of the above amount shall
be kept as fixed deposit. By the way, this fixed deposit gives some
stability to the chapters, where generally the members shall try to
make the programs self-sustaining. The name of the bank account of the
chapter is oits-rkl.
</p>
<p>

Rourkela chapter at present has seventeen members. The secretary as below
has intimated that the following office bearers have taken charge:
</p>
<p>
1. President:  G Panda, NIT Rourkela
</p>
<p>
2. Secretary:  D P Acharya, RIMS
</p>
<p>
3. Treasurer:  Barnali  Pradhan, RIMS
</p>
<p>

Let us wish rourkela chapter all success.

</b>
</p>
<p>
Some oits members of Berhampur University, NIST, and NIC belonging to 
berhampur met on 29th March and resolved that they wish to open the 
berhampur chapter of oits. They also elected the following members as office
bearers:
</p>
<p>
President: M R Patra (BU)
</p>
<p>
Vice-President: R K Dash (NIC)
</p>
<p>
Secretary: Indraneel Mukhopadhyay (NIST)
</p>
<p>
Treasurer: S K Padhi (BU)
</p>
<p>
I received the above communication from the secretary on 30.3.2004. We
discussed the matter in the executive committee on 31.3.2004, and decided
that the opening of the berhampur chapter be approved, and that the same
may be followed up by the new executive committee.

</b>
</p>
<p>
OITS has started bringing out a Bulletin with semi-technical articles with
the first issue (December, 2003) being inaugurated during cit2003. It was
initially thought that it would an yearly bulletin, but then in the last
general body it was decided that it may come out during June and December
of every year. This can be viewed/downloaded from 
<a href="bulletin/index-2.html"> www.oits.org/bulletin
</a>. This, along with
many very interesting articles, contains an article by S P Misra indicating
the gradual evolution of oits.

</font>
</left>
</p>
<p>
The Conference, organised by Orissa Information Technology Society (OITS) and
Silicon Institute of Technology de facto extended from 21st December to 25th
December, 2003. On 21st, there was a Symposium on IT and Education mainly
organised by the Silicon Institute where there were seven speakers from
different parts of India. This was conducted by Neharika Vohra from IIM,
ahmedabad.
</p>
<p>
In the afternoon the same day, there was an inauguration function for the
Conference. Here N R Mohanty, Chairman, HAL, Bangalore, was the Chief Guest,
Damodar Acharya, Vice-Chancellor, Biju Patnaik University of Technology, was
the guest of honour, and, Vinay Deshpande, chairman, Encore Software Pvt. Ltd.
Bangalore was the Chief Speaker. P K Dash welcomed all, Sudeshna Sarkar spoke
about the Conference, and S P Misra gave a vote of thanks. All the three
guests gave wonderful inspiring talks with a common theme being to have a
sense of confidence by all of us that things are happening, will happen, and
in IT or in other fields, we need not be second to any other country.
</p>
<p>
The main Conference was from 22nd December to 24th December in Swosti Plaza,
Bhubaneswar. During the Conference, there were three keynote talks (by (i) S K
Tripathy, UCR, USA, (ii) Y Pratt, UT, Arlington, USA, (iii) Sajal Das, UT,
Arlington, USA), eight invited talks and three advanced tutorials. Around 
230 delegates from 12 countries including India registered for the Conference, 
and 122 presented their papers in the different technical sessions. There was
also an industry session with the theme as "India sustaining leadership
position in the global IT market".
</p>
<p>
On 24th afternoon, the valedictory function took place as the last function
of the Conference. S P Misra, President, OITS, conducted the same. The
program chairs briefly recapitulated the salient features of the Conference,
and then, as in the last year, the results of the two best paper awards
were given. (i) Amiya K Pujari IT award of Rs.5000/- and a certificate for
the best paper among all the papers submitted and presented in the Conference 
went to Joydeep Ghosh of University of Texas, Austin, USA, for the paper
entitled "A probabilistic approach to privacy-sensitive distributed data
mining" done in collaboration with Srujana Merigu; (ii) Narayan Misra IT award
of Rs.4000/- and a certificate for the best paper among all the papers 
submitted from Orissa and presented in the Conference went to D P Das, 
Silicon Inst of Tech, bbsr, for the paper entitled "Electricity distribution 
data mining using soft computing and modified wavelet analysis" done in 
collaboration with P K Dash.
</p>
<p>
On 25th December, in addition to the three advanced tutorials during the
Conference, six tutorials were organised, two of six hour duration, and four
of three hour duration, at Hotel Swosti Plaza. All the tutorials were
approximately with sixty participants each, and were well received.
</p>
<p>

 I.   Organisation of CITs:
</font>
</left>
</b>
</p>
<p>
In the general body meeting of december 23rd, 2003, the following observations
regarding organisation of cits were made:
It was decided that CIT could be held outside orissa if we find
organisers/sponsors. However, the frequency  of  hosting outside orissa can
not exceed once in three years.
</p>
<p>

It was also noted that cit2004 had been decided by the existing 
steering committee to be at hyderabad and was appreciated by  
members as the exposure of oits members to the IT scenario in hyderabad 
will be helpful to take up similar activities in orissa.
</p>
<p>

Consistent with the spirit of the earlier CITs, it was recommended by the
general body that (i) for academic participants in cit2004, the registration
fees from inside India for academics be Rs.2000/-, (ii) oits members as such 
shall have a discount of 25%, and, (iii) oits members who do not have 
institutional or project support shall have a discount of 50%, subject to their
certifying to that effect.
</p>
<p>
<left>
<b> Steering Committee of CITs:</b></left>
It was also felt desirable that the constitution of the steering
committee practised since december 1999 needs to be modified. It was thought
desirable to have four permanent members here, and some rotating members.
After some discussions, it was thought that the permanent members may
be (two  from USA  and two from India)
</p>
<p>

1. Prasant Mohapatra
</p>
<p>

2. R N  Mohapatra   (Steering Chair)
</p>
<p>

3. G Panda (NIT rourkela)
</p>
<p>

4. S P Misra
</p>
<p>

It  was also decided  that the rotating members of the nth cit shall  be
the general chair(s), the program chairs and the organising chair of the 
(n-1)th cit along with the incumbent president of oits during the period 
of the conference.
</p>
<p>

Thus the general body resolution of december 1999 now stands replaced by the 
above. There is an article in the bulletin regarding the progressive evolution
of the CITs regarding organisation matters.
</p>
<p>

As is the  procedure now, these members of the steering committee shall
seek suggestions/offers from different mebers/institutions as they may think
appropriate. The steering committee list shall be intimated to all the oits
members as soon as possible.

 K.   OITS Accounts:
</font>
</left>
</b>
</p>
<p>
There were 48 new life members, one donor member, one institutional member, and
one more life member who registered with the sambalpur chapter. The total
membership of OITS now stands at 222, including three life members who
registered with the sambalpur chapter during the workshop in March. NIST, 
conducting cit2001 had not returned an advance of Rs.20,000/- given to them;
they have now returned the same along with an additional Rs.2000/-. The balance
from cit2002 amounting to about Rs.1,95,000/- was a good addition to corpus
of funds of oits, of which about Rs.2000/- was spent for auditing the
accounts of the same.  We particularly appreciate the generous assistance of 
Orissa Society of Americas of an amoount of about Rs.48,600/- to oits 
through personal contributions. Income from IT olympiad roughly balanced
the expenditure in conducting the same; however, from OITS funds we have
paid about Rs.20,000/- as prize money, which we hope will focus on
IT activities for the students. Also, OITS transferred a sum of 
about Rs.22,000/- from our corpus of funds to the corpus of funds of
sambalpur and rourkela chapters for opening of the two chapters, and we hope
the new executive committee will do the same for berhampur chapter.
</p>
<p>
The balance with oits at present is Rs.6,88,888.62 of which about
Rs.6,36,400/- is kept in fixed deposits.
