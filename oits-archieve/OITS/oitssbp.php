			<h2>Workshop on Parallel Computing and Bio-Informatics</h2>
			<strong>Organised by sambalpur chapter</strong> <i>22nd and 23rd March, 2004</i>
			<hr>

			<p>Here 141 delegates had registered for the workshop. Out of them, there were 10 life members of OIT-sbp, 13 faculties from nearby colleges, rest being students from different branches like MCA, Engnieering. Msc comp. sc., Physics, Mathematics, Botany and Life Sciences.</p>

In the second Session some more developements in the problems of parallel alogorithms with multiprogramming and multi processing systems were considered.</p>

			<p>The uniqueness in the workshop was practical demonstrations as needed. Ajit kumar Nayak, Silicon Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar, demonstrated in two different sessions about clustering of different work stations through Linux with the syntax to write programs using MPI. The programmes were demonstrated to the students. This approch creates a lot of interest among the students for the problems of parallel algorithms.</p>
