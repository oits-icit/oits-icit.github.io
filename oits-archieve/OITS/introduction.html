in the state of Orissa (in the east coast of India). 
Some of our major activities are: to hold an annual conferences 
on information technology  in Orissa; to establish an information 
technology library in Orissa; to introduce additional information 
technology related programs (e.g. B.Sc (Hons) in Computer Science), 
and revamp exisiting programs; to promote Internet use in Orissa; etc.
