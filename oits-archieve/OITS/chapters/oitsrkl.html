              ROURKELA CHAPTER
</center>
</b>
</p>
<p>

In late december, 2003, a letter was received from Prof Sourya Patnaik,
director, rourkela institute of management studies (rims)
with a list of ten new members from rims along with a request to open a 
chapter of oits at rourkela. The Institute was rated as among the top 40 
B-schools, and had MCA programs along with business school programs. We 
already had quite  a  few oits  members in nit rourkela, and it was thougt 
that such chapter shall be serving  the  aims and objectives of oits for 
the spread of IT in orissa.
</p>
<p>

S Patnaik and sreekumar both of rims acted as convenors of the chapter. They 
further requested that they already had a program for faculty improvement 
scheduled for 8th January, 2004, and it would be nice to inaugurate the 
rourkela chapter of oits then with the faculty improvement program being the 
first function under its auspices. However, as per rules oits executive 
committee needs  to approve the opening of a chapter for which time was not
available. Since opening of this chapter was  totally parallel to  the
opening of the sambalpur chapter, the president rang up some executive
committee members, and with their approval intimated Prof Patnaik that we may 
do so.
</p>
<p>

The chapter was inaugurated on 8th january, 2004 by again, Prof M C Dash,
vice-chancellor, sambalpur university. The function was attended by the
president, oits, who welcomed the delegates, by Prof S Padhy, who spoke
about IT and oits, Prof G Panda, who elaborated on many aspects of IT to 
emphasize that IT is so interdisciplinary that it could hardly be regarded
as an  independent subject. Prof Sourya  Patnaik presided  over the function
and intimated that they had requested Prof Panda of NIT Rourkela to be the 
president of the chapter and he had kindly agreed.
</p>
<p>

One  thing about Prof Panda's  talk particularly impressed me. He said
that he can train computer students to be self-reliant and through
software development, through this training,  earn their own livelihood
at a comfortable level. I do hope that through his leadership, this will
come to happen, in which case  rourkela  chapter will lead oits and all
IT lovers about a very positive action.
</p>
<p>

The afternoon programe was devoted to the workshop on financial computation
where  an expert from finance introduced the subject, and Prof Padhy talked
about the computational modelling of the corresponding theories. It was
attended by more than twenty-five participants spread from different colleges
in orissa. It is very well known that economic models have  become highly
mathematical, and with the  need  for wide-scale data bases, computational
finance is  becoming a very important area of IT.
</p>
<p>

The executive committee of oits met on 12.1.2004 where it discusssed about 
the opening of the rourkela chapter, and approved the same.
</p>
<p>

Rourkela chapter started with the seed money of Rs.11,210+Rs.8,000, the
first above being the money transferred from oits membership fees, and
the second being a donation by S P Misra, who was Professor at (then)
REC Rourkela for ten years. He also thougt that the amount should be
reasonable, since as per rules at least half of the above amount shall
be kept as fixed deposit. By the way, this fixed deposit gives some
stability to the chapters, where generally the members shall try to
make the programs self-sustaining. The name of the bank account of the
chapter is oits-rkl.
</p>
<p>
