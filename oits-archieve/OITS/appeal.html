Idea of having OITS: Orissa Information Technology Society, infact,
took shape on Internet in 1997. And it's a pleasure to see the society has been
formed with active participations of professionals from all over the
world. OITS has been successful in organising a National Conference
on Information Technology at Bhuabaneshwar in last December. It
also takes credit in pursuading Orissa Govt. to float B.Sc(Computer
Science) curriculum.  Ofcourse, what has been achieved is not enough
in this competitive world. To meet the future with prospect, OITS has
several plans. Let me take this oppertunity to tell you some issues in
this regard.
<P>
More or less, you all are aware of state of IT education in Orissa. In
comparison to our neighbouring state AP, we remain far behind in
IT education as well as enterpreneurship. Such, backwardness has
serious ramifications in social life. Realising  this OITS plans to stir up
IT education in three ways:<P> 1. Introducing new regular education programme<P>
2. Introducing mass education programme<P> 3. Encouraging private enterprises
in IT education. In addition OITS plans to act as a catalyst in providing
employments to youths coming out successfully with IT education.
<P>
Towards greater cause of science, the society plans to bring out a
research journal. Also publishing a communication for IT professionals
and enterpreneurs is in agenda. OITS envisages to set up Samanta
Chandrasekhar Institute of System Sciences - an institute
of excellence as a token of respect to our great ancient scientist
from Orissa.
<P>
Other than Education, OITS gives equal importance to Business.
It plans to play a role in creating investment friendly atmosphere
in Orissa by bridging gaps among enterpreneurs, Government and
education institutes. OITS finds its unique role to play for better
causes of Orissa.
<P>
Let me drive in some reasoning for your participation in the IT
movement being ushered by OITS. In fact there are many. If you
are an educationist, you will find a lot of interest and satisfaction
in working with OITS education programmes and conferences.
As a social worker, you are encouraged to initiate a novel mass IT
education programme. As an enterpreneur, I'm sure you will find
a lot of scope being a part of OITS family. Range of business includes:
Training , Development  (both for off-shore and internal markets) ,  Maintenace for both Computer
and Communication systems. If you are interested in culture, I'm sure, a lot of
job is to be done to preserve and popularize Oriya Culture using recent
IT. I may not be right way able to enumerate all the reasons here. I'm sure
you will find many more reasons  to join OITS.

<P>
On behalf of OITS I appeal you to join OITS and give your hand in
IT movement of Orissa.  In this year December , OITS is organizing
an  International IT Conference at Bhubaneshwar. I invite and wish
to see  you there.
<P>
Wish you an enjoyable time in OSA Convention.
<P>
Namaskar.
